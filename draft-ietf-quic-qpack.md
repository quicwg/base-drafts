# Introduction

The QUIC transport protocol was designed from the outset to support HTTP
semantics, and its design subsumes many of the features of HTTP/2.  HTTP/2 uses
HPACK ({{!RFC7541}}) for header compression, but QUIC's stream multiplexing
comes into some conflict with HPACK.  A key goal of the design of QUIC is to
improve stream multiplexing relative to HTTP/2 by reducing head-of-line
blocking.  If HPACK were used for HTTP/3, it would induce head-of-line
blocking due to built-in assumptions of a total ordering across frames on all
streams.

QUIC is described in {{QUIC-TRANSPORT}}.  The HTTP/3 mapping is described in
{{HTTP3}}. For a full description of HTTP/2, see {{?RFC7540}}. The
description of HPACK is {{!RFC7541}}.

QPACK reuses core concepts from HPACK, but is redesigned to allow correctness in
the presence of out-of-order delivery, with flexibility for implementations to
balance between resilience against head-of-line blocking and optimal compression
ratio.  The design goals are to closely approach the compression ratio of HPACK
with substantially less head-of-line blocking under the same loss conditions.

## Conventions and Definitions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 {{!RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}}
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

Definitions of terms that are used in this document:

Header field:

: A name-value pair sent as part of an HTTP message.

Header list:

: An ordered collection of header fields associated with an HTTP message.  A
  header list can contain multiple header fields with the same name.  It can
  also contain duplicate header fields.

Header block:

: The compressed representation of a header list.

Encoder:

: An implementation which transforms a header list into a header block.

Decoder:

: An implementation which transforms a header block into a header list.

Absolute Index:

Base:

: A reference point for relative indicies.  Dynamic references are made relative
  to a Base in header blocks.

Insert Count:

: The total number of entries inserted in the dynamic table.

QPACK is a name, not an acronym.

## Notational Conventions

Diagrams use the format described in Section 3.1 of {{?RFC2360}}, with the
following additional conventions:

x (A)
: Indicates that x is A bits long

x (A+)
: Indicates that x uses the prefixed integer encoding defined in Section 5.1 of
  [RFC7541], beginning with an A-bit prefix.

x ...
: Indicates that x is variable-length and extends to the end of the region.

# Compression Process Overview

Like HPACK, QPACK uses two tables for associating header fields to indices.  The
static table (see {{table-static}}) is predefined and contains common header
fields (some of them with an empty value).  The dynamic table (see
{{table-dynamic}}) is built up over the course of the connection and can be used
by the encoder to index header fields in the encoded header lists.

QPACK instructions appear in three different types of streams:

- The encoder uses a unidirectional stream to modify the state of the dynamic
table without emitting header fields associated with any particular request.

- HEADERS and PUSH_PROMISE frames on request and push streams reference the
table state without modifying it.

- The decoder sends feedback to the encoder on a unidirectional stream.  This
feedback enables the encoder to manage dynamic table state.

## Encoder

An encoder compresses a header list by emitting either an indexed or a literal
representation for each header field in the list.  References to the static
table and literal representations do not require any dynamic state and never
risk head-of-line blocking.  References to the dynamic table risk head-of-line
blocking if the encoder has not received an acknowledgement indicating the entry
is available at the decoder.

An encoder MAY insert any entry in the dynamic table it chooses; it is not
limited to header fields it is compressing.

QPACK preserves the ordering of header fields within each header list.  An
encoder MUST emit header field representations in the order they appear in the
input header list.

QPACK is designed to contain the more complex state tracking to the encoder,
while the decoder is relatively simple.

### Reference Tracking

An encoder MUST ensure that a header block which references a dynamic table
entry is not received by the decoder after the referenced entry has been
evicted.  Hence the encoder needs to track information about each compressed
header block that references the dynamic table until that header block is
acknowledged by the decoder.

### Blocked Dynamic Table Insertions {#blocked-insertion}

An encoder MUST NOT insert an entry into the dynamic table (or duplicate an
existing entry) if doing so would evict an entry with unacknowledged references.
For header blocks that might rely on the newly added entry, the encoder can use
a literal representation.

To ensure that the encoder is not prevented from adding new entries, the encoder
can avoid referencing entries that are close to eviction.  Rather than
reference such an entry, the encoder can emit a Duplicate instruction (see
{{duplicate}}), and reference the duplicate instead.

Determining which entries are too close to eviction to reference is an encoder
preference.  One heuristic is to target a fixed amount of available space in the
dynamic table: either unused space or space that can be reclaimed by evicting
unreferenced entries.  To achieve this, the encoder can maintain a draining
index, which is the smallest absolute index in the dynamic table that it will
emit a reference for.  As new entries are inserted, the encoder increases the
draining index to maintain the section of the table that it will not reference.
If the encoder does not create new references to entries with an absolute index
lower than the draining index, the number of unacknowledged references to those
entries will eventually become zero, allowing them to be evicted.

### Avoiding Head-of-Line Blocking {#overview-hol-avoidance}

Because QUIC does not guarantee order between data on different streams, a
header block might reference an entry in the dynamic table that has not yet been
received.

Each header block contains a Required Insert Count, the lowest possible value
for the Insert Count with which the header block can be decoded. For a header
block with references to the dynamic table, the Required Insert Count is one
larger than the largest Absolute Index of all referenced dynamic table
entries. For a header block with no references to the dynamic table, the
Required Insert Count is zero.

If the decoder encounters a header block with a Required Insert Count value
larger than defined above, it MAY treat this as a stream error of type
HTTP_QPACK_DECOMPRESSION_FAILED.  If the decoder encounters a header block with
a Required Insert Count value smaller than defined above, it MUST treat this as
a stream error of type HTTP_QPACK_DECOMPRESSION_FAILED as prescribed in
{{invalid-references}}.

When the Required Insert Count is zero, the frame contains no references to the
dynamic table and can always be processed immediately.

If the Required Insert Count is greater than the number of dynamic table entries
received, the stream is considered "blocked."  While blocked, header field data
SHOULD remain in the blocked stream's flow control window.  A stream becomes
unblocked when the Insert Count becomes greater than or equal to the Required
Insert Count for all header blocks the decoder has started reading from the
stream.

The SETTINGS_QPACK_BLOCKED_STREAMS setting (see {{configuration}}) specifies an
upper bound on the number of streams which can be blocked. An encoder MUST limit
the number of streams which could become blocked to the value of
SETTINGS_QPACK_BLOCKED_STREAMS at all times. Note that the decoder might not
actually become blocked on every stream which risks becoming blocked.  If the
decoder encounters more blocked streams than it promised to support, it MUST
treat this as a stream error of type HTTP_QPACK_DECOMPRESSION_FAILED.

An encoder can decide whether to risk having a stream become blocked. If
permitted by the value of SETTINGS_QPACK_BLOCKED_STREAMS, compression efficiency
can often be improved by referencing dynamic table entries that are still in
transit, but if there is loss or reordering the stream can become blocked at the
decoder.  An encoder avoids the risk of blocking by only referencing dynamic
table entries which have been acknowledged, but this could mean using
literals. Since literals make the header block larger, this can result in the
encoder becoming blocked on congestion or flow control limits.

### Known Received Count

In order to identify which dynamic table entries can be safely used without a
stream becoming blocked, the encoder tracks the number of entries received by
the decoder.  The Known Received Count tracks the total number of acknowledged
insertions.

When blocking references are permitted, the encoder uses header block
acknowledgement to maintain the Known Received Count, as described in
{{header-acknowledgement}}.

To acknowledge dynamic table entries which are not referenced by header blocks,
for example because the encoder or the decoder have chosen not to risk blocked
streams, the decoder sends an Insert Count Increment instruction (see
{{insert-count-increment}}).


## Decoder

As in HPACK, the decoder processes header blocks and emits the corresponding
header lists. It also processes dynamic table modifications from instructions on
the encoder stream.

The decoder MUST emit header fields in the order their representations appear in
the input header block.


### State Synchronization

The decoder stream ({{decoder-stream}}) signals key events at the decoder that
permit the encoder to track the decoder's state.  These events are:

- Complete processing of a header block
- Abandonment of a stream which might have remaining header blocks
- Receipt of new dynamic table entries

Knowledge that a header block with references to the dynamic table has been
processed permits the encoder to evict entries to which no unacknowledged
references remain, regardless of whether those references were potentially
blocking (see {{blocked-insertion}}).  When a stream is reset or abandoned, the
indication that these header blocks will never be processed serves a similar
function; see {{stream-cancellation}}.

The decoder chooses when to emit Insert Count Increment instructions (see
{{insert-count-increment}}). Emitting an instruction after adding each new
dynamic table entry will provide the most timely feedback to the encoder, but
could be redundant with other decoder feedback. By delaying an Insert Count
Increment instruction, the decoder might be able to coalesce multiple Insert
Count Increment instructions, or replace them entirely with Header
Acknowledgements (see {{header-acknowledgement}}). However, delaying too long
may lead to compression inefficiencies if the encoder waits for an entry to be
acknowledged before using it.

### Blocked Decoding

To track blocked streams, the Required Insert Count value for each stream can be
used.  Whenever the decoder processes a table update, it can begin decoding any
blocked streams that now have their dependencies satisfied.


# Header Tables

Unlike in HPACK, entries in the QPACK static and dynamic tables are addressed
separately.  The following sections describe how entries in each table are
addressed.

## Static Table {#table-static}

The static table consists of a predefined static list of header fields, each of
which has a fixed index over time.  Its entries are defined in {{static-table}}.

Note the QPACK static table is indexed from 0, whereas the HPACK static table
is indexed from 1.

When the decoder encounters an invalid static table index on a request stream or
push stream it MUST treat this as a stream error of type
`HTTP_QPACK_DECOMPRESSION_FAILED`.  If this index is received on the encoder
stream, this MUST be treated as a connection error of type
`HTTP_QPACK_ENCODER_STREAM_ERROR`.

## Dynamic Table {#table-dynamic}

The dynamic table consists of a list of header fields maintained in first-in,
first-out order.  The dynamic table is initially empty.  Entries are added by
instructions on the encoder stream (see {{encoder-stream}}).

The dynamic table can contain duplicate entries (i.e., entries with the same
name and same value).  Therefore, duplicate entries MUST NOT be treated as an
error by the decoder.


### Dynamic Table Size

The size of the dynamic table is the sum of the size of its entries.

The size of an entry is the sum of its name's length in bytes (as defined in
{{string-literals}}), its value's length in bytes, and 32.

The size of an entry is calculated using the length of its name and value
without Huffman encoding applied.


### Dynamic Table Capacity and Eviction {#eviction}

The encoder sets the capacity of the dynamic table, which serves as the upper
limit on its size.

Before a new entry is added to the dynamic table, entries are evicted from the
end of the dynamic table until the size of the dynamic table is less than or
equal to (table capacity - size of new entry) or until the table is empty. The
encoder MUST NOT evict a dynamic table entry unless it has first been
acknowledged by the decoder.

If the size of the new entry is less than or equal to the dynamic table
capacity, then that entry is added to the table.  It is an error if the encoder
attempts to add an entry that is larger than the dynamic table capacity; the
decoder MUST treat this as a connection error of type
`HTTP_QPACK_ENCODER_STREAM_ERROR`.

A new entry can reference an entry in the dynamic table that will be evicted
when adding this new entry into the dynamic table.  Implementations are
cautioned to avoid deleting the referenced name or value if the referenced entry
is evicted from the dynamic table prior to inserting the new entry.

Whenever the dynamic table capacity is reduced by the encoder, entries are
evicted from the end of the dynamic table until the size of the dynamic table is
less than or equal to the new table capacity.  This mechanism can be used to
completely clear entries from the dynamic table by setting a capacity of 0,
which can subsequently be restored.


### Maximum Dynamic Table Capacity

To bound the memory requirements of the decoder, the decoder limits the maximum
value the encoder is permitted to set for the dynamic table capacity.  In
HTTP/3, this limit is determined by the value of
SETTINGS_QPACK_MAX_TABLE_CAPACITY sent by the decoder (see {{configuration}}).
The encoder MUST not set a dynamic table capacity that exceeds this maximum, but
it can choose to use a lower dynamic table capacity (see
{{set-dynamic-capacity}}).


### Initial Dynamic Table Capacity

The initial dynamic table capacity is determined by the corresponding setting
when HTTP requests or responses are first permitted to be sent.  For clients
using 0-RTT data in HTTP/3, the initial table capacity is the remembered value
of the setting, even if the server later specifies a larger maximum dynamic
table capacity in its SETTINGS frame.  For HTTP/3 servers and HTTP/3 clients
when 0-RTT is not attempted or is rejected, the initial table capacity is the
value of the setting in the peer's SETTINGS frame.


### Absolute Indexing {#indexing}

Each entry possesses both an absolute index which is fixed for the lifetime of
that entry and a relative index which changes based on the context of the
reference. The first entry inserted has an absolute index of "0"; indices
increase by one with each insertion.


### Relative Indexing

The relative index begins at zero and increases in the opposite direction from
the absolute index.  Determining which entry has a relative index of "0" depends
on the context of the reference.

On the encoder stream, a relative index of "0" always refers to the most
recently inserted value in the dynamic table.  Note that this means the entry
referenced by a given relative index will change while interpreting instructions
on the encoder stream.

~~~~~
{: title="Example Dynamic Table Indexing - Control Stream"}

Unlike on the encoder stream, relative indices on push and request streams are
relative to the Base at the beginning of the header block (see
{{header-prefix}}). This ensures that references are stable even if the dynamic
table is updated while decoding a header block.

The Base is encoded as a value relative to the Required Insert Count. The Base
identifies which dynamic table entries can be referenced using relative
indexing, starting with 0 at the last entry added.

Post-Base references are used for entries inserted after base, starting at 0 for
the first entry added after the Base, see {{post-base}}.

d = count of entries dropped
~~~~~
{: title="Example Dynamic Table Indexing - Relative Index on Request Stream"}


### Post-Base Indexing {#post-base}

A header block on the request stream can reference entries added after the entry
identified by the Base. This allows an encoder to process a header block in a
single pass and include references to entries added while processing this (or
other) header blocks. Newly added entries are referenced using Post-Base
instructions. Indices for Post-Base instructions increase in the same direction
as absolute indices, with the zero value being the first entry inserted after
the Base.

{: title="Example Dynamic Table Indexing - Post-Base Index on Request Stream"}


### Invalid References

If the decoder encounters a reference on a request or push stream to a dynamic
table entry which has already been evicted or which has an absolute index
greater than or equal to the declared Required Insert Count (see
{{header-prefix}}), it MUST treat this as a stream error of type
`HTTP_QPACK_DECOMPRESSION_FAILED`.

If the decoder encounters a reference on the encoder stream to a dynamic table
entry which has already been dropped, it MUST treat this as a connection error
of type `HTTP_QPACK_ENCODER_STREAM_ERROR`.

# Wire Format

## Primitives

### Prefixed Integers

The prefixed integer from Section 5.1 of [RFC7541] is used heavily throughout
this document.  The format from [RFC7541] is used unmodified.  QPACK
implementations MUST be able to decode integers up to 62 bits long.

### String Literals

The string literal defined by Section 5.2 of [RFC7541] is also used throughout.
This string format includes optional Huffman encoding.

HPACK defines string literals to begin on a byte boundary.  They begin with a
single flag (indicating whether the string is Huffman-coded), followed by the
Length encoded as a 7-bit prefix integer, and finally Length bytes of data.
When Huffman encoding is enabled, the Huffman table from Appendix B of [RFC7541]
is used without modification.

This document expands the definition of string literals and permits them to
begin other than on a byte boundary.  An "N-bit prefix string literal" begins
with the same Huffman flag, followed by the length encoded as an (N-1)-bit
prefix integer.  The remainder of the string literal is unmodified.

A string literal without a prefix length noted is an 8-bit prefix string literal
and follows the definitions in [RFC7541] without modification.

## Stream Types

QPACK instructions occur in three locations, each of which uses a separate
instruction space:

 - The encoder stream is a unidirectional stream of type `0x48` (ASCII 'H')
   which carries table updates from encoder to decoder.

 - The decoder stream is a unidirectional stream of type `0x68` (ASCII 'h')
   which carries acknowledgements of table modifications and header processing
   from decoder to encoder.

 - Finally, the contents of HEADERS and PUSH_PROMISE frames on request streams
   and push streams reference the QPACK table state.

<!-- s/exactly/no more than/  ? -->
There MUST be exactly one of each unidirectional stream type in each direction.
Receipt of a second instance of either stream type MUST be treated as a
connection error of HTTP_WRONG_STREAM_COUNT.  These streams MUST NOT be closed.
Closure of either unidirectional stream MUST be treated as a connection error of
type HTTP_CLOSED_CRITICAL_STREAM.

This section describes the instructions which are possible on each stream type.

## Encoder Stream {#encoder-stream}

Table updates can add a table entry, possibly using existing entries to avoid
transmitting redundant information.  The name can be transmitted as a reference
to an existing entry in the static or the dynamic table or as a string literal.
For entries which already exist in the dynamic table, the full entry can also be
used by reference, creating a duplicate entry.

The contents of the encoder stream are an unframed sequence of the following
instructions.

### Insert With Name Reference

An addition to the header table where the header field name matches the header
field name of an entry stored in the static table or the dynamic table starts
with the '1' one-bit pattern.  The `S` bit indicates whether the reference is to
the static (S=1) or dynamic (S=0) table. The 6-bit prefix integer (see Section
5.1 of [RFC7541]) that follows is used to locate the table entry for the header
name.  When S=1, the number represents the static table index; when S=0, the
number is the relative index of the entry in the dynamic table.

The header name reference is followed by the header field value represented as a
string literal (see Section 5.2 of [RFC7541]).

   +-------------------------------+
~~~~~~~~~~
{: title="Insert Header Field -- Indexed Name"}


### Insert Without Name Reference

An addition to the header table where both the header field name and the header
field value are represented as string literals (see {{primitives}}) starts with
the '01' two-bit pattern.

The name is represented as a 6-bit prefix string literal, while the value is
represented as an 8-bit prefix string literal.

   +---+---------------------------+
   |  Value String (Length bytes)  |
   +-------------------------------+
~~~~~~~~~~
{: title="Insert Header Field -- New Name"}


### Duplicate {#duplicate}

Duplication of an existing entry in the dynamic table starts with the '000'
three-bit pattern.  The relative index of the existing entry is represented as
an integer with a 5-bit prefix.

~~~~~~~~~~ drawing
     0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7

   | 0 | 0 | 0 |    Index (5+)     |
   +---+---+---+-------------------+
~~~~~~~~~~
{:#fig-index-with-duplication title="Duplicate"}

The existing entry is re-inserted into the dynamic table without resending
either the name or the value. This is useful to mitigate the eviction of older
entries which are frequently referenced, both to avoid the need to resend the
header and to avoid the entry in the table blocking the ability to insert new
headers.

### Set Dynamic Table Capacity {#set-dynamic-capacity}

An encoder informs the decoder of a change to the dynamic table capacity using
an instruction which begins with the '001' three-bit pattern.  The new dynamic
table capacity is represented as an integer with a 5-bit prefix (see Section 5.1
of [RFC7541]).

~~~~~~~~~~ drawing
  0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| 0 | 0 | 1 |   Capacity (5+)   |
+---+---+---+-------------------+
~~~~~~~~~~
{:#fig-set-capacity title="Set Dynamic Table Capacity"}

The new capacity MUST be lower than or equal to the limit described in
{{maximum-dynamic-table-capacity}}.  In HTTP/3, this limit is the value of the
SETTINGS_QPACK_MAX_TABLE_CAPACITY parameter (see {{configuration}}) received
from the decoder.  The decoder MUST treat a new dynamic table capacity value
that exceeds this limit as a connection error of type
`HTTP_QPACK_ENCODER_STREAM_ERROR`.

Reducing the dynamic table capacity can cause entries to be evicted (see
{{eviction}}).  This MUST NOT cause the eviction of entries with outstanding
references (see {{reference-tracking}}).  Changing the capacity of the dynamic
table is not acknowledged as this instruction does not insert an entry.


## Decoder Stream

The decoder stream carries information used to ensure consistency of the dynamic
table. Information is sent from the decoder to the encoder; that is, the server
informs the client about the processing of the client's header blocks and table
updates, and the client informs the server about the processing of the server's
header blocks and table updates.

The contents of the decoder stream are an unframed sequence of the following
instructions.

### Insert Count Increment

The Insert Count Increment instruction begins with the '00' two-bit pattern.
The instruction specifies the total number of dynamic table inserts and
duplications since the last Insert Count Increment or Header Acknowledgement
that increased the Known Received Count for the dynamic table (see
{{known-received-count}}).  The Increment field is encoded as a 6-bit prefix
integer. The encoder uses this value to determine which table entries might
cause a stream to become blocked, as described in {{state-synchronization}}.

~~~~~~~~~~ drawing
  0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| 0 | 0 |     Increment (6+)    |
+---+---+-----------------------+
~~~~~~~~~~
{:#fig-size-sync title="Insert Count Increment"}

An encoder that receives an Increment field equal to zero or one that increases
the Known Received Count beyond what the encoder has sent MUST treat this as a
connection error of type `HTTP_QPACK_DECODER_STREAM_ERROR`.

### Header Acknowledgement

After processing a header block whose declared Required Insert Count is not
zero, the decoder emits a Header Acknowledgement instruction on the decoder
stream.  The instruction begins with the '1' one-bit pattern and includes the
request stream's stream ID, encoded as a 7-bit prefix integer.  It is used by
the peer's encoder to know when it is safe to evict an entry, and possibly
update the Known Received Count.

+---+---------------------------+
~~~~~~~~~~
{:#fig-header-ack title="Header Acknowledgement"}

The same Stream ID can be identified multiple times, as multiple header blocks
can be sent on a single stream in the case of intermediate responses, trailers,
and pushed requests.  Since header frames on each stream are received and
processed in order, this gives the encoder precise feedback on which header
blocks within a stream have been fully processed.

If an encoder receives a Header Acknowledgement instruction referring to a
stream on which every header block with a non-zero Required Insert Count has
already been acknowledged, that MUST be treated as a connection error of type
`HTTP_QPACK_DECODER_STREAM_ERROR`.

When blocking references are permitted, the encoder uses acknowledgement of
header blocks to update the Known Received Count.  If a header block was
potentially blocking, the acknowledgement implies that the decoder has received
all dynamic table state necessary to process the header block.  If the Required
Insert Count of an acknowledged header block was greater than the encoder's
current Known Received Count, the block's Required Insert Count becomes the new
Known Received Count.


### Stream Cancellation

The instruction begins with the '01' two-bit pattern. The instruction includes
the stream ID of the affected stream - a request or push stream - encoded as a
6-bit prefix integer.

~~~~~~~~~~
{:#fig-stream-cancel title="Stream Cancellation"}

A stream that is reset might have multiple outstanding header blocks with
dynamic table references.  When an endpoint receives a stream reset before the
end of a stream, it generates a Stream Cancellation instruction on the decoder
stream.  Similarly, when an endpoint abandons reading of a stream it needs to
signal this using the Stream Cancellation instruction.  This signals to the
encoder that all references to the dynamic table on that stream are no longer
outstanding.  A decoder with a maximum dynamic table capacity equal to zero (see
{{maximum-dynamic-table-capacity}}) MAY omit sending Stream Cancellations,
because the encoder cannot have any dynamic table references.

An encoder cannot infer from this instruction that any updates to the dynamic
table have been received.


## Request and Push Streams

HEADERS and PUSH_PROMISE frames on request and push streams reference the
dynamic table in a particular state without modifying it.  Frames on these
streams emit the headers for an HTTP request or response.

### Header Block Prefix {#header-prefix}

Each header block is prefixed with two integers.  The Required Insert Count is
encoded as an integer with an 8-bit prefix after the encoding described in
{{ric}}).  The Base is encoded as sign-and-modulus integer, using a single sign
bit and a value with a 7-bit prefix (see {{base}}).

These two values are followed by instructions for compressed headers.  The
entire block is expected to be framed by the using protocol.

#### Required Insert Count {#ric}

Required Insert Count identifies the state of the dynamic table needed to
process the header block.  Blocking decoders use the Required Insert Count to
determine when it is safe to process the rest of the block.

The encoder transforms the Required Insert Count as follows before encoding:

~~~
   if ReqInsertCount == 0:
      EncInsertCount = 0
   else:
      EncInsertCount = (ReqInsertCount mod (2 * MaxEntries)) + 1
~~~

Here `MaxEntries` is the maximum number of entries that the dynamic table can
have.  The smallest entry has empty name and value strings and has the size of
32.  Hence `MaxEntries` is calculated as

~~~
   MaxEntries = floor( MaxTableCapacity / 32 )
~~~

`MaxTableCapacity` is the maximum capacity of the dynamic table as specified by
the decoder (see {{maximum-dynamic-table-capacity}}).


The decoder reconstructs the Required Insert Count using the following
algorithm, where TotalNumberOfInserts is the total number of inserts into the
decoder's dynamic table:

~~~
   if EncodedInsertCount == 0:
      ReqInsertCount = 0
   else:
      InsertCount = EncodedInsertCount - 1
      CurrentWrapped = TotalNumberOfInserts mod (2 * MaxEntries)

      if CurrentWrapped >= InsertCount + MaxEntries:
         # Insert Count wrapped around 1 extra time
         ReqInsertCount += 2 * MaxEntries
      else if CurrentWrapped + MaxEntries < InsertCount:
         # Decoder wrapped around 1 extra time
         CurrentWrapped += 2 * MaxEntries

      ReqInsertCount += TotalNumberOfInserts - CurrentWrapped
~~~

This encoding limits the length of the prefix on long-lived connections.

For example, if the dynamic table is 100 bytes, then the Required Insert Count
will be encoded modulo 6.  If a decoder has received 10 inserts, then an encoded
value of 3 indicates that the Required Insert Count is 9 for the header block.

#### Base {#base}

The `Base` is used to resolve references in the dynamic table as described in
{{relative-indexing}}.

To save space, the Base is encoded relative to the Insert Count using a one-bit
sign and the `Delta Base` value.  A sign bit of 0 indicates that the Base is
greater than or equal to the value of the Insert Count; the value of Delta Base
is added to the Insert Count to determine the value of the Base.  A sign bit of
1 indicates that the Base is less than the Insert Count.  That is:

~~~
   if S == 0:
      Base = ReqInsertCount + DeltaBase
   else:
      Base = ReqInsertCount - DeltaBase - 1
~~~

A single-pass encoder determines the Base before encoding a header block.  If
the encoder inserted entries in the dynamic table while encoding the header
block, Required Insert Count will be greater than the Base, so the encoded
difference is negative and the sign bit is set to 1.  If the header block did
not reference the most recent entry in the table and did not insert any new
entries, the Base will be greater than the Required Insert Count, so the delta
will be positive and the sign bit is set to 0.

An encoder that produces table updates before encoding a header block might set
Required Insert Count and the Base to the same value.  In such case, both the
sign bit and the Delta Base will be set to zero.

A header block that does not reference the dynamic table can use any value for
the Base; setting Delta Base to zero is the most efficient encoding.

For example, with an Required Insert Count of 9, a decoder receives a S bit of 1
and a Delta Base of 2.  This sets the Base to 6 and enables post-base indexing
for three entries.  In this example, a regular index of 1 refers to the 5th
entry that was added to the table; a post-base index of 1 refers to the 8th
entry.


### Indexed Header Field

An indexed header field representation identifies an entry in either the static
table or the dynamic table and causes that header field to be added to the
decoded header list, as described in Section 3.2 of [RFC7541].

~~~~~~~~~~ drawing
  0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| 1 | S |      Index (6+)       |
+---+---+-----------------------+
~~~~~~~~~~
{: title="Indexed Header Field"}

If the entry is in the static table, or in the dynamic table with an absolute
index less than the Base, this representation starts with the '1' 1-bit pattern,
followed by the `S` bit indicating whether the reference is into the static
(S=1) or dynamic (S=0) table. Finally, the relative index of the matching header
field is represented as an integer with a 6-bit prefix (see Section 5.1 of
[RFC7541]).


### Indexed Header Field With Post-Base Index

If the entry is in the dynamic table with an absolute index greater than or
equal to the Base, the representation starts with the '0001' 4-bit pattern,
followed by the post-base index (see {{post-base}}) of the matching header
field, represented as an integer with a 4-bit prefix (see Section 5.1 of
[RFC7541]).

~~~~~~~~~~
{: title="Indexed Header Field with Post-Base Index"}


### Literal Header Field With Name Reference

A literal header field with a name reference represents a header where the
header field name matches the header field name of an entry stored in the static
table or the dynamic table.

If the entry is in the static table, or in the dynamic table with an absolute
index less than the Base, this representation starts with the '01' two-bit
pattern.  If the entry is in the dynamic table with an absolute index greater
than or equal to the Base, the representation starts with the '0000' four-bit
pattern.

The following bit, 'N', indicates whether an intermediary is permitted to add
this header to the dynamic header table on subsequent hops. When the 'N' bit is
set, the encoded header MUST always be encoded with a literal representation. In
particular, when a peer sends a header field that it received represented as a
literal header field with the 'N' bit set, it MUST use a literal representation
to forward this header field.  This bit is intended for protecting header field
values that are not to be put at risk by compressing them (see Section 7.1 of
[RFC7541] for more details).

   |  Value String (Length bytes)  |
   +-------------------------------+
~~~~~~~~~~
{: title="Literal Header Field With Name Reference"}

For entries in the static table or in the dynamic table with an absolute index
less than the Base, the header field name is represented using the relative
index of that entry, which is represented as an integer with a 4-bit prefix (see
Section 5.1 of [RFC7541]). The `S` bit indicates whether the reference is to the
static (S=1) or dynamic (S=0) table.

### Literal Header Field With Post-Base Name Reference

For entries in the dynamic table with an absolute index greater than or equal to
the Base, the header field name is represented using the post-base index of that
entry (see {{post-base}}) encoded as an integer with a 3-bit prefix.

{: title="Literal Header Field With Post-Base Name Reference"}


### Literal Header Field Without Name Reference

An addition to the header table where both the header field name and the header
field value are represented as string literals (see {{primitives}}) starts with
the '001' three-bit pattern.

The fourth bit, 'N', indicates whether an intermediary is permitted to add this
header to the dynamic header table on subsequent hops. When the 'N' bit is set,
the encoded header MUST always be encoded with a literal representation. In
particular, when a peer sends a header field that it received represented as a
literal header field with the 'N' bit set, it MUST use a literal representation
to forward this header field.  This bit is intended for protecting header field
values that are not to be put at risk by compressing them (see Section 7.1 of
[RFC7541] for more details).

The name is represented as a 4-bit prefix string literal, while the value is
represented as an 8-bit prefix string literal.

#  Configuration

QPACK defines two settings which are included in the HTTP/3 SETTINGS frame.

  SETTINGS_QPACK_MAX_TABLE_CAPACITY (0x1):
  : An integer with a maximum value of 2^30 - 1.  The default value is zero
    bytes.  See {{table-dynamic}} for usage.  This is the equivalent of the
    SETTINGS_HEADER_TABLE_SIZE from HTTP/2.

  SETTINGS_QPACK_BLOCKED_STREAMS (0x7):
  : An integer with a maximum value of 2^16 - 1.  The default value is zero.
    See {{overview-hol-avoidance}}.


# Error Handling {#error-handling}

The following error codes are defined for HTTP/3 to indicate failures of
QPACK which prevent the stream or connection from continuing:

HTTP_QPACK_DECOMPRESSION_FAILED (TBD):
: The decoder failed to interpret an instruction on a request or push stream and
  is not able to continue decoding that header block.

HTTP_QPACK_ENCODER_STREAM_ERROR (TBD):
: The decoder failed to interpret an instruction on the encoder stream.

HTTP_QPACK_DECODER_STREAM_ERROR (TBD):
: The encoder failed to interpret an instruction on the decoder stream.

Upon encountering an error, an implementation MAY elect to treat it as a
connection error even if this document prescribes that it MUST be treated as a
stream error.

# Change Log

> **RFC Editor's Note:** Please remove this section prior to publication of a
> final version of this document.

## Since draft-ietf-quic-qpack-05

- Introduced the terms dynamic table capacity and maximum dynamic table
  capacity.
- Renamed SETTINGS_HEADER_TABLE_SIZE to SETTINGS_QPACK_MAX_TABLE_CAPACITY.

## Since draft-ietf-quic-qpack-04

- Changed calculation of Delta Base Index to avoid an illegal value (#2002,
  #2005)

## Since draft-ietf-quic-qpack-03

- Change HTTP settings defaults (#2038)
- Substantial editorial reorganization

## Since draft-ietf-quic-qpack-02

- Largest Reference encoded modulo MaxEntries (#1763)
- New Static Table (#1355)
- Table Size Update with Insert Count=0 is a connection error (#1762)
- Stream Cancellations are optional when SETTINGS_HEADER_TABLE_SIZE=0 (#1761)
- Implementations must handle 62 bit integers (#1760)
- Different error types for each QPACK stream, other changes to error
  handling (#1726)
- Preserve header field order (#1725)
- Initial table size is the maximum permitted when table is first usable (#1642)

## Since draft-ietf-quic-qpack-01

- Only header blocks that reference the dynamic table are acknowledged (#1603,
  #1605)

## Since draft-ietf-quic-qpack-00

- Renumbered instructions for consistency (#1471, #1472)
- Decoder is allowed to validate largest reference (#1404, #1469)
- Header block acknowledgments also acknowledge the associated largest reference
  (#1370, #1400)
- Added an acknowledgment for unread streams (#1371, #1400)
- Removed framing from encoder stream (#1361,#1467)
- Control streams use typed unidirectional streams rather than fixed stream IDs
  (#910,#1359)

## Since draft-ietf-quic-qcram-00

- Separate instruction sets for table updates and header blocks (#1235, #1142,
  #1141)
- Reworked indexing scheme (#1176, #1145, #1136, #1130, #1125, #1314)
- Added mechanisms that support one-pass encoding (#1138, #1320)
- Added a setting to control the number of blocked decoders (#238, #1140, #1143)
- Moved table updates and acknowledgments to dedicated streams (#1121, #1122,
  #1238)
