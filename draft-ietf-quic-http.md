# Introduction

The QUIC transport protocol has several features that are desirable in a
transport for HTTP, such as stream multiplexing, per-stream flow control, and
low-latency connection establishment. This document describes a mapping of HTTP
semantics over QUIC, drawing heavily on the existing TCP mapping, HTTP/2.
Specifically, this document identifies HTTP/2 features that are subsumed by
QUIC, and describes how the other features can be implemented atop QUIC.

QUIC is described in {{QUIC-TRANSPORT}}.  For a full description of HTTP/2, see
{{!RFC7540}}.


## Notational Conventions

The words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", and "MAY" are used in this document.
It's not shouting; when they are capitalized, they have the special meaning
defined in {{!RFC2119}}.


# QUIC Advertisement

An HTTP origin advertises the availability of an equivalent HTTP/QUIC endpoint
via the Alt-Svc HTTP response header or the HTTP/2 ALTSVC frame ({{!RFC7838}}),
using the ALPN token defined in {{connection-establishment}}.

For example, an origin could indicate in an HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2 response that
HTTP/QUIC was available on UDP port 50781 at the same hostname by including the
following header in any response:

~~~ example
Alt-Svc: hq=":50781"
~~~

On receipt of an Alt-Svc header indicating HTTP/QUIC support, a client MAY
attempt to establish a QUIC connection to the indicated host and port and, if
successful, send HTTP requests using the mapping described in this document.

Connectivity problems (e.g. firewall blocking UDP) can result in QUIC connection
establishment failure, in which case the client SHOULD continue using the
existing connection or try another alternative endpoint offered by the origin.

Servers MAY serve HTTP/QUIC on any UDP port.  Servers MUST use the same port
across all IP addresses that serve a single domain, and SHOULD NOT change this
port.

## QUIC Version Hints {#alt-svc-version-hint}

This document defines the "quic" parameter for Alt-Svc, which MAY be used to
provide version-negotiation hints to HTTP/QUIC clients. QUIC versions are
four-octet sequences with no additional constraints on format. Syntax:

~~~ abnf
quic = version-number
version-number = 1*8HEXDIG; hex-encoded QUIC version
~~~

Leading zeros SHOULD be omitted for brevity.  When multiple versions are
supported, the "quic" parameter MAY be repeated multiple times in a single
Alt-Svc entry.  For example, if a server supported both version 0x00000001 and
the version rendered in ASCII as "Q034", it could specify the following header:

~~~ example
Alt-Svc: hq=":49288";quic=1;quic=51303334
~~~

Where multiple versions are listed, the order of the values reflects the
server's preference (with the first value being the most preferred version).
Origins SHOULD list only versions which are supported by the alternative, but
MAY omit supported versions for any reason.


# Connection Establishment {#connection-establishment}

HTTP/QUIC connections are established as described in {{QUIC-TRANSPORT}}. During
connection establishment, HTTP/QUIC support is indicated by selecting the ALPN
token "hq" in the crypto handshake.

While connection-level options pertaining to the core QUIC protocol are set in
the initial crypto handshake, HTTP-specific settings are conveyed
in the SETTINGS frame. After the QUIC connection is established, a SETTINGS
frame ({{frame-settings}}) MUST be sent as the initial frame of the HTTP control
stream (Stream ID 1, see {{stream-mapping}}).  The server MUST NOT send data on
any other stream until the client's SETTINGS frame has been received.

## Draft Version Identification

> **RFC Editor's Note:**  Please remove this section prior to publication of a
> final version of this document.

Only implementations of the final, published RFC can identify themselves as
"hq". Until such an RFC exists, implementations MUST NOT identify themselves
using this string.

Implementations of draft versions of the protocol MUST add the string "-" and
the corresponding draft number to the identifier. For example,
draft-ietf-quic-http-01 is identified using the string "hq-01".

Non-compatible experiments that are based on these draft versions MUST append
the string "-" and an experiment name to the identifier. For example, an
experimental implementation based on draft-ietf-quic-http-09 which reserves an
extra stream for unsolicited transmission of 1980s pop music might identify
itself as "hq-09-rickroll". Note that any label MUST conform to the "token"
syntax defined in Section 3.2.6 of [RFC7230]. Experimenters are encouraged to
coordinate their experiments on the quic@ietf.org mailing list.


# Stream Mapping and Usage {#stream-mapping}

A QUIC stream provides reliable in-order delivery of bytes, but makes no
guarantees about order of delivery with regard to bytes on other streams. On the
wire, data is framed into QUIC STREAM frames, but this framing is invisible to
the HTTP framing layer. A QUIC receiver buffers and orders received STREAM
frames, exposing the data contained within as a reliable byte stream to the
application.

QUIC reserves Stream 0 for crypto operations (the handshake, crypto config
updates). Stream 1 in both directions is reserved for sending and receiving HTTP
control frames.  The resulting bidirectional channel is analogous to HTTP/2's
Stream 0.  This connection control stream pair is considered critical to the
HTTP connection.  If either connection control stream is closed for any reason,
this MUST be treated as a connection error of type QUIC_CLOSED_CRITICAL_STREAM.

When HTTP headers and data are sent over QUIC, the QUIC layer handles most of
the stream management. An HTTP request/response consumes a bidirectional pair of
streams in each direction.

Aside from the connection control stream, the beginning of each stream starts
with a short stream header ({{stream-header}}).  This stream header is used to
identify the type of stream and to link the stream to another stream as
necessary.

\[Editor's Note: the following is clearly busted.  Requests and responses can't
reliably be cancelled as a result of this change.  We will need QPACK/QCRAM for
this to work.] Request, response and push streams contain HPACK data which
manipulates connection-level state.  Therefore, these streams MUST NOT be closed
with a stream-level error.

New streams use the next available QUIC stream.  Data streams SHOULD be opened
after the request, response or push stream is opened.  Data streams are closed
after transferring the body.  Data streams are not opened for messages that
contain no body and messages that contain an empty body.

HTTP does not need to do any separate multiplexing when using QUIC - data sent
over a QUIC stream always maps to a particular HTTP transaction. Requests and
responses are considered complete when the corresponding QUIC streams are
closed.


## Stream Header

The stream header is used to correlate unidirectional streams with ongoing
request/response exchanges, including the response to server push with the
PUSH_PROMISE containing the request.  There is no stream header for
bidirectional streams; the stream is correlated at the QUIC layer.

The stream header consists of a single octet that identifies the type of stream,
plus any parameters that are specific to the stream type.

## Stream Types

The stream types are summarized in {{stream-type-table}}.

| Stream Type        | Code | Section             |
|:-------------------|-----:|:--------------------|
| Connection Control | n/a  | {{stream-control}}  |
| Request            | n/a  | {{stream-request}}  |
| Data               | 0x00 | {{stream-data}}     |
| Push               | 0x01 | {{stream-push}}     |
{: #stream-type-table title="Stream Types"}

An endpoint MUST terminate the connection with an HTTP_INVALID_STREAM_HEADER
error if it receives a stream header that uses an unknown or unsupported type.


### Stream 1: Connection Control Stream {#stream-control}

Stream 1 is a bidirectional stream opened by the client and is used for
the SETTINGS frame immediately after the connection opens.  After the SETTINGS
frame has been sent, this stream is used for PRIORITY and CANCEL_REQUEST frames.


### Request Streams {#stream-request}

Request streams are bidirectional streams opened by the client.  Request streams
carry the headers and any trailers of requests from the client to the server.
In the server-to-client direction, request streams carry the headers and
optional trailers of responses, plus any promises for server push.

Request streams contain a sequence of frames (see {{http-framing-layer}}).


### Data Streams {#stream-data}

Data streams are unidirectional streams opened by both clients and servers. Data
streams carry the payload body of requests or responses.

The stream header for a data stream contains the type octet, which is set to
0x00, and the stream ID of a request stream as a 32-bit value.

~~~~~
 0                   1                   2                   3
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|   Type (8)    |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|                        Stream ID (32)                         |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
~~~~~

After the stream header, data streams contain the octets of the payload body.
Data streams do not carry frames.

Data streams MUST reference a request stream.  The referenced stream MUST
include a HAS_BODY frame in the same direction.  If a data stream is received
that references a stream of a different type, the referenced stream does not
include a HAS_BODY frame, or another data stream already references the
identified steam, then the connection MUST be terminated with a
HTTP_UNMATCHED_DATA error.  Note that due to reordering of packets, the
referenced stream or HAS_BODY frame might not have been received when the data
stream is opened.


### Push Streams {#stream-push}

Push streams are unidirectional streams opened by servers.  Push streams carry
headers of responses for use with server push.

The stream header for a push stream contains the type octet, which is set to
0x01, and the push ID from a PUSH_PROMISE frame (see {{frame-push-promise}}).

~~~~~
 0                   1                   2                   3
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|   Type (8)    |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|                         Push ID (32)                          |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
~~~~~

After the stream header, push streams contain a sequence of frames (see
{{http-framing-layer}}).

A push stream references a server push request by including the Push ID field
from a PUSH_PROMISE frame that was sent on a response stream, see
{{frame-push-promise}} for details.  Note that due to reordering of packets, the
PUSH_PROMISE frame might not have been received when the push stream is opened.


## HTTP Message Exchanges

A client sends an HTTP request on a new bidirectional stream
({{stream-request}}). A server sends an HTTP response on the corresponding
stream, managed by the QUIC layer.

An HTTP message (request or response) consists of:

1. one header block (see {{frame-headers}}) on the request or response stream
   containing the message headers (see {{!RFC7230}}, Section 3.2),

2. optionally, the payload body (see {{!RFC7230}}, Section 3.3), which is sent
   on the data stream if the request or response stream includes a HAS_BODY
   frame after the initial header block (see {{frame-has-body}}),

3. optionally, one header block on the request or response stream containing the
   trailer-part, if present (see {{!RFC7230}}, Section 4.1.2).

In addition, prior to sending the message header block indicated above, a
response may contain zero or more header blocks on the response stream
containing the message headers of informational (1xx) HTTP responses (see
{{!RFC7230}}, Section 3.2 and {{!RFC7231}}, Section 6.2).

A message that contains a payload body includes a HAS_BODY frame immediately
after the first header block.  This indicates that another stream will include
the payload body.  A data stream is opened to carry the payload body.  The data
stream MUST be closed immediately after sending the body.  If the message does
not contain a body, a data stream MUST NOT be opened and the HAS_BODY message
MUST NOT be sent.  The "chunked" transfer encoding defined in Section 4.1 of
{{!RFC7230}} MUST NOT be used.

Trailing header fields are carried in an additional header block on the request,
response or push stream. Such a header block is a sequence of HEADERS frames
with End Header Block set on the last frame. Senders MUST send only one header
block in the trailers section; receivers MUST decode any subsequent header
blocks in order to maintain HPACK decoder state, but the resulting output MUST
be discarded.

An HTTP request/response exchange fully consumes a bidirectional stream, as well
as a unidirectional stream for each payload body that is present.  After sending
a request, a client closes the streams it used for sending the request and any
request body; after sending a response, the server closes the streams it used
for sending the request and any payload body.

A server can send a complete response prior to the client sending an entire
request if the response does not depend on any portion of the request that has
not been sent and received.  A server can request that the client cease
transmission and retransmission of stream data on the stream or streams that
carry the request by sending a DISINTEREST frame on those streams (TBD).


### Header Compression

HTTP/QUIC uses HPACK header compression as described in {{!RFC7541}}. HPACK was
designed for HTTP/2 with the assumption of in-order delivery such as that
provided by TCP. A sequence of encoded header blocks must arrive (and be
decoded) at an endpoint in the same order in which they were encoded. This
ensures that the dynamic state at the two endpoints remains in sync.

QUIC streams provide in-order delivery of data sent on those streams, but there
are no guarantees about order of delivery between streams. To achieve in-order
delivery of HEADERS frames in QUIC, the HPACK-bearing frames contain a counter
which can be used to ensure in-order processing. Data (request/response bodies)
which arrive out of order are buffered until the corresponding HEADERS arrive.

This does introduce head-of-line blocking: if the packet containing HEADERS for
stream N is lost or reordered then the HEADERS for stream N+4 cannot be
processed until it has been retransmitted successfully, even though the HEADERS
for stream N+4 may have arrived.

DISCUSS:
: Keep HPACK with HOLB? Redesign HPACK to be order-invariant? How much
do we need to retain compatibility with HTTP/2's HPACK?


### The CONNECT Method

The pseudo-method CONNECT ({{!RFC7231}}, Section 4.3.6) is primarily used with
HTTP proxies to establish a TLS session with an origin server for the purposes
of interacting with "https" resources. In HTTP/1.x, CONNECT is used to convert
an entire HTTP connection into a tunnel to a remote host. In HTTP/2, the CONNECT
method is used to establish a tunnel over a single HTTP/2 stream to a remote
host for similar purposes.

A CONNECT request in HTTP/QUIC functions in the same manner as in HTTP/2. The
request MUST be formatted as described in {{!RFC7540}}, Section 8.3. A CONNECT
request that does not conform to these restrictions is malformed. The message
data stream MUST NOT be closed at the end of the request.

A proxy that supports CONNECT establishes a TCP connection ({{!RFC0793}}) to the
server identified in the ":authority" pseudo-header field. Once this connection
is successfully established, the proxy sends a HEADERS frame containing a 2xx
series status code to the client, as defined in {{!RFC7231}}, Section 4.3.6, on
the response stream.

The request and response streams for the CONNECT method MUST include a HAS_BODY
frame.  The data received on the data streams associated with this exchange
correspond directly to data sent on the TCP connection. Any QUIC STREAM frame
sent by the client is transmitted by the proxy to the TCP server; data received
from the TCP server is written to the data stream by the proxy. Note that the
size and number of TCP segments is not guaranteed to map predictably to the size
and number of QUIC STREAM frames.

The TCP connection can be closed by either peer. When the client closes the data
stream, the proxy will set the FIN bit on its connection to the TCP server.
When the proxy receives a packet with the FIN bit set, it will close the
corresponding data stream. TCP connections which remain closed in a single
direction are not invalid, but are often handled poorly by servers, so clients
SHOULD NOT close streams for connections on which they are still expecting data.

A TCP connection error is signaled with RST_STREAM. A proxy treats any error in
the TCP connection, which includes receiving a TCP segment with the RST bit set,
as a stream error of type HTTP_CONNECT_ERROR ({{http-error-codes}}).
Correspondingly, a proxy MUST send a TCP segment with the RST bit set if it
detects an error with the stream or the QUIC connection.

## Request Prioritization {#priority}

HTTP/QUIC uses the priority scheme described in {{!RFC7540}} Section 5.3. In
this priority scheme, a given request can be designated as dependent upon
another request, which expresses the preference that the latter stream (the
"parent" request) be allocated resources before the former stream (the
"dependent" request). Taken together, the dependencies across all requests in a
connection form a dependency tree. The structure of the dependency tree changes
as PRIORITY frames add, remove, or change the dependency links between requests.

HTTP/2 defines its priorities in terms of streams whereas HTTP over QUIC
identifies requests.  The PRIORITY frame {{frame-priority}} identifies a request
either by identifying a request stream ({{stream-request}}) or by using a Push
ID ({{frame-push-promise}}).  Other than the means of identifying requests, the
prioritization system is identical to that in HTTP/2.

Only a client can prioritize requests.  A server MUST NOT send a PRIORITY frame.


## Server Push

HTTP/QUIC supports server push as described in {{!RFC7540}}. During connection
establishment, the client indicates whether it is willing to receive server
pushes via the SETTINGS_DISABLE_PUSH setting in the SETTINGS frame (see
{{connection-establishment}}), which defaults to 1 (true).

As with server push for HTTP/2, the server initiates a server push by sending a
PUSH_PROMISE frame that includes request header fields attributed to the
request. The PUSH_PROMISE frame is sent on a response stream.  Unlike HTTP/2,
the PUSH_PROMISE does not reference a stream; when a server fulfills a promise,
the stream that carries the response headers references the PUSH_PROMISE.  This
allows a server to fulfill promises in the order that best suits its needs.

The server push response is conveyed on a push stream.  Aside from the stream
header, which identifies the Push ID, a push stream is identical to the response
on a request stream ({{stream-request}}), with response headers and (if present)
trailers carried by HEADERS frames sent on the push stream, and response body
(if any) indicated with a HAS_BODY frame and associated data stream.


# HTTP Framing Layer {#http-framing-layer}

Frames are used only on the connection (stream 1) and request, response, and
push streams.  Other streams carry data payload and are not framed at the HTTP
layer.

This section describes HTTP framing in QUIC and highlights some differences from
HTTP/2 framing.  For more detail on differences from HTTP/2, see {{h2-frames}}.

## Frame Layout

All frames have the following format:

~~~~~~~~~~ drawing
    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
~~~~~~~~~~
{: #fig-frame title="HTTP/QUIC frame format"}

## Frame Definitions {#frames}

### HAS_BODY {#frame-has-body}

The HAS_BODY frame (type=0x0) indicates that the HTTP message contains a payload
body.  It is sent after the initial header block on a request, response, or push
stream.

The HAS_BODY frame has no flags and is always empty.  A HAS_BODY frame with a
non-empty payload or flags that are set MUST be treated as a
HTTP_MALFORMED_HAS_BODY error.


### HEADERS {#frame-headers}

The HEADERS frame (type=0x1) is used to carry part of a header set, compressed
using HPACK {{!RFC7541}}.

One flag is defined:

  End Header Block (0x4):
  : This frame concludes a header block.

A HEADERS frame with any other flags set MUST be treated as a connection error
of type HTTP_MALFORMED_HEADERS.

~~~~~~~~~~  drawing
    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |       Sequence? (16)          |    Header Block Fragment (*)...
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
~~~~~~~~~~
{: #fig-headers title="HEADERS frame payload"}

The HEADERS frame payload has the following fields:

  Sequence Number:
  : Present only on the first frame of a header block sequence. This MUST
  be set to zero on the first header block sequence, and incremented on
  each header block.

The next frame on the same stream after a HEADERS frame without the EHB flag set
MUST be another HEADERS frame. A receiver MUST treat the receipt of any other
type of frame as a stream error of type HTTP_INTERRUPTED_HEADERS. (Note that
QUIC can intersperse data from other streams between frames, or even during
transmission of frames, so multiplexing is not blocked by this requirement.)

A full header block is contained in a sequence of zero or more HEADERS frames
without EHB set, followed by a HEADERS frame with EHB set.

On receipt, header blocks (HEADERS, PUSH_PROMISE) MUST be processed by the HPACK
decoder in sequence. If a block is missing, all subsequent HPACK frames MUST be
held until it arrives, or the connection terminated.

When the Sequence counter reaches its maximum value (0xFFFF), the next increment
returns it to zero.  An endpoint MUST NOT wrap the Sequence counter to zero
until the previous zero-value header block has been confirmed received.


### PRIORITY {#frame-priority}

The PRIORITY (type=0x02) frame specifies the sender-advised priority of a stream
and is substantially different from {{!RFC7540}}. In order to support ordering,
it MUST be sent only on the connection control stream.  A PRIORITY frame sent on
any other stream MUST be treated as a HTTP_WRONG_STREAM error.

The format of this frame has been modified from the definition in HTTP/2 to
accommodate not being sent on-stream and the larger stream ID space of QUIC.
The semantics of the Stream Dependency, Weight, and E flag are the same as in
HTTP/2.

The flags defined are:

  PUSH_PRIORITIZED (0x04):
  : Indicates that the Prioritized Stream is a server push rather than a
    request.  If set, this flag indicates that the Prioritized Stream identifies
    a response stream and the Promise Index field is present.

  PUSH_DEPENDENT (0x02):
  : Indicates a dependency on a pushed request.  If set, this flag indicates
    that the Dependent Stream identifies a response stream and that the
    Dependent Promise Index field is present.

  E (0x01):
  : Indicates that the stream dependency is exclusive (see {{!RFC7540}} Section
    5.3).

~~~~~~~~~~  drawing
    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                    Dependent Request (32)                     |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |   Weight (8)  |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
~~~~~~~~~~
{: #fig-priority title="PRIORITY frame payload"}

The PRIORITY frame payload has the following fields:

  Prioritized Request:
  : A 32-bit identifier for a request.  This contains the stream ID of a request
    stream when the PUSH_PRIORITIZED flag is clear, or a push ID when the PUSH
    flag is set.

  Stream Dependency:
  : A 32-bit stream identifier for a dependent request.  This contains the
    stream ID of a request stream when the PUSH_DEPENDENT flag is clear, or a
    push ID when the PUSH_DEPENDENT flag is set.  A request stream ID of 0
    indicates a dependency on the root stream. For details of dependencies,
    see {{priority}} and {!RFC7540}} Section 5.3).

  Weight:
  : An unsigned 8-bit integer representing a priority weight for the stream (see
    {{!RFC7540}} Section 5.3). Add one to the value to obtain a weight between 1
    and 256.

A PRIORITY frame identifies a request to priotize, and a request upon which that
request is dependent.  A request is identified by the stream ID of a request
when the corresponding PUSH_PRIORITIZED or PUSH_DEPENDENT flag is not set.
Setting the PUSH or PUSH_DEPENDENT flag causes the frame to identify a
PUSH_PROMISE using a Push ID (see {{frame-push-promise}} for details).

A PRIORITY frame MAY identify no request by using a stream ID of 0; as in
{{!RFC7540}}, this makes the request dependent on the root of the dependency
tree.

A PRIORITY frame that does not reference a request MUST be treated as a
HTTP_MALFORMED_PRIORITY error, unless it references stream ID 0.  A PRIORITY
that sets a PUSH_PRIORITIZED or PUSH_DEPENDENT flag, but then references a
non-existent Push ID MUST be treated as a HTTP_MALFORMED_PRIORITY error.

The length of a PRIORITY frame is 9 octets.  A PRIORITY frame with any other
length MUST be treated as a connection error of type HTTP_MALFORMED_PRIORITY.


### CANCEL_REQUEST {#frame-cancel-request}

The CANCEL_REQUEST frame (type=0x3) is used to request cancellation of a request
prior to the response stream being created.  This frame can be used to cancel
both outstanding requests initiated by a client and server push requests that
are initiated with a PUSH_PROMISE.

The frame identifies a client-initiated request by the stream ID that carried
the request; a server push request is identified by Push ID (see
{{frame-push-promise}}).

Upon receipt of this frame the server aborts sending the response for the
identified request.  If the server has not yet started to send the response
stream for the identified request, it can use the receipt of a CANCEL_REQUEST
frame to avoid opening a stream.  If a response stream or data stream has been
opened by the server, the server SHOULD sent a QUIC RST_STREAM frame on those
streams and cease transmission of the response.

A client that cancels a request that it initiated SHOULD send a QUIC RST_STREAM
frame to reset the associated request stream, unless that stream is already
closed.

A client sends a CANCEL_REQUEST frame on the connection control stream.  Sending
a CANCEL_REQUEST frame on a stream other than the connection control stream MUST
be treated as a HTTP_WRONG_STREAM error.

The flags defined are:

  PUSH (0x01):
  : When set, this flag indicates that the frame identifies a push by its push
    ID; when cleared, the frame identifies a request stream.

~~~~~~~~~~
{: #fig-cancel-request title="CANCEL_REQUEST frame payload"}

The CANCEL_REQUEST frame payload has the following fields:

  Request Stream/Push ID:
  : A 32-bit stream ID or Push ID that identifies the request.  If the PUSH flag
    is set, this refers to a Push ID included in a PUSH_PROMISE frame (see
    {{frame-push-promise}}); if the PUSH flag is cleared, this refers to a
    request by its stream ID.

A CANCEL_REQUEST frame always contains a four octet payload.  A server MUST
treat a CANCEL_REQUEST frame payload that is other than 8 octets in length, or a
CANCEL_REQUEST frame that identifies a stream that doesn't carry a valid request
as an HTTP_MALFORMED_CANCEL_REQUEST error.  Note however that due to packet
reordering, a CANCEL_REQUEST frame could arrive before the request stream that
it references is opened.


### SETTINGS {#frame-settings}

The SETTINGS frame (type=0x4) conveys configuration parameters that affect how
endpoints communicate, such as preferences and constraints on peer behavior, and
is substantially different from {{!RFC7540}}. Individually, a SETTINGS parameter
can also be referred to as a "setting".

SETTINGS parameters are not negotiated; they describe characteristics of the
sending peer, which can be used by the receiving peer. However, a negotiation
can be implied by the use of SETTINGS -- a peer uses SETTINGS to advertise a set
of supported values. The recipient can then choose which entries from this list
are also acceptable and proceed with the value it has chosen. (This choice could
be announced in a field of an extension frame, or in its own value in SETTINGS.)

Different values for the same parameter can be advertised by each peer. For
example, a client might permit a very large HPACK state table while a server
chooses to use a small one to conserve memory.

Parameters MUST NOT occur more than once.  A receiver MAY treat the presence of
the same parameter more than once as a connection error of type
HTTP_MALFORMED_SETTINGS.

The SETTINGS frame defines no flags.

The payload of a SETTINGS frame consists of zero or more parameters, each
consisting of an unsigned 16-bit setting identifier and a length-prefixed binary
value.

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
{: #fig-ext-settings title="SETTINGS value format"}

A zero-length content indicates that the setting value is a Boolean and true.
False is indicated by the absence of the setting.

Non-zero-length values MUST be compared against the remaining length of the
SETTINGS frame.  Any value which purports to cross the end of the frame MUST
cause the SETTINGS frame to be considered malformed and trigger a connection
error of type HTTP_MALFORMED_SETTINGS.

An implementation MUST ignore the contents for any SETTINGS identifier it does
not understand.

SETTINGS frames always apply to a connection, never a single stream.  A SETTINGS
frame MUST be sent as the first frame of the connection control stream (see
{{stream-mapping}}) by each peer, and MUST NOT be sent subsequently or on any
other stream. If an endpoint receives an SETTINGS frame on a different stream,
the endpoint MUST respond with a connection error of type HTTP_WRONG_STREAM.  If
an endpoint receives a second SETTINGS frame, the endpoint MUST respond with a
connection error of type HTTP_MULTIPLE_SETTINGS.

The SETTINGS frame affects connection state. A badly formed or incomplete
SETTINGS frame MUST be treated as a connection error (Section 5.4.1) of type
HTTP_MALFORMED_SETTINGS.


#### Integer encoding

Settings which are integers are transmitted in network byte order.  Leading
zero octets are permitted, but implementations SHOULD use only as many bytes as
are needed to represent the value.  An integer MUST NOT be represented in more
bytes than would be used to transfer the maximum permitted value.

#### Defined SETTINGS Parameters {#settings-parameters}

The following settings are defined in HTTP/QUIC:

  SETTINGS_HEADER_TABLE_SIZE (0x1):
  : An integer with a maximum value of 2^32 - 1.

  SETTINGS_DISABLE_PUSH (0x2):
  : Transmitted as a Boolean; replaces SETTINGS_ENABLE_PUSH

  SETTINGS_MAX_HEADER_LIST_SIZE (0x6):
  : An integer with a maximum value of 2^32 - 1.

#### Usage in 0-RTT

When a 0-RTT QUIC connection is being used, the client's initial requests will
be sent before the arrival of the server's SETTINGS frame.  Clients SHOULD
cache at least the following settings about servers:

  - SETTINGS_HEADER_TABLE_SIZE
  - SETTINGS_MAX_HEADER_LIST_SIZE

Clients MUST comply with cached settings until the server's current settings are
received.  If a client does not have cached values, it SHOULD assume the
following values:

  - SETTINGS_HEADER_TABLE_SIZE:  0 octets
  - SETTINGS_MAX_HEADER_LIST_SIZE:  16,384 octets

Servers MAY continue processing data from clients which exceed its current
configuration during the initial flight.  In this case, the client MUST apply
the new settings immediately upon receipt.

If the connection is closed because these or other constraints were violated
during the 0-RTT flight (e.g. with HTTP_HPACK_DECOMPRESSION_FAILED), clients MAY
establish a new connection and retry any 0-RTT requests using the settings sent
by the server on the closed connection. (This assumes that only requests that
are safe to retry are sent in 0-RTT.) If the connection was closed before the
SETTINGS frame was received, clients SHOULD discard any cached values and use
the defaults above on the next connection.


### PUSH_PROMISE {#frame-push-promise}

The PUSH_PROMISE frame (type=0x05) is used to carry a request header set from
server to client, as in HTTP/2.  It defines no flags.

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
~~~~~~~~~~
{: #fig-push-promise title="PUSH_PROMISE frame payload"}

The payload consists of:

  Push ID:
  : A 32-bit identifier for the server push request.  This identifier is used in
    push stream headers ({{stream-push}}), CANCEL_REQUEST frames
    ({{frame-cancel-request}}), and PRIORITY frames ({{frame-priority}}) to
    identify this request.  A server MUST create a unique value for each
    PUSH_PROMISE frame that it generates on the same connection.

  HPACK Sequence:
  : A 16-bit counter, equivalent to the Sequence field in HEADERS

  Payload:
  : HPACK-compressed request headers for the promised response.


# Error Handling {#errors}

QUIC allows the application to abruptly terminate individual streams or the
entire connection when an error is encountered.  These are referred to as
"stream errors" or "connection errors" and are described in more detail in
[QUIC-TRANSPORT].

HTTP/QUIC requires that only data streams be terminated abruptly.  Terminating a
request, response or push stream will result in an error of type
HTTP_RST_CONTROL_STREAM.  The CANCEL_REQUEST frame can be used to cleanly abort
a request without affecting connection state.

This section describes HTTP-specific error codes which can be used to express
the cause of a connection or stream error.

## HTTP-Defined QUIC Error Codes {#http-error-codes}

QUIC allocates error codes 0x0000-0x3FFF to application protocol definition.
The following error codes are defined by HTTP for use in QUIC RST_STREAM,
GOAWAY, and CONNECTION_CLOSE frames.

HTTP_PUSH_REFUSED (0x01):
: The server has attempted to push content which the client will not accept
  on this connection.

HTTP_INTERNAL_ERROR (0x02):
: An internal error has occurred in the HTTP stack.

HTTP_PUSH_ALREADY_IN_CACHE (0x03):
: The server has attempted to push content which the client has cached.

HTTP_REQUEST_CANCELLED (0x04):
: The client no longer needs the requested data.

HTTP_HPACK_DECOMPRESSION_FAILED (0x05):
: HPACK failed to decompress a frame and cannot continue.

HTTP_CONNECT_ERROR (0x06):
: The connection established in response to a CONNECT request was reset or
  abnormally closed.

HTTP_EXCESSIVE_LOAD (0x07):
: The endpoint detected that its peer is exhibiting a behavior that might be
  generating excessive load.

HTTP_VERSION_FALLBACK (0x08):
: The requested operation cannot be served over HTTP/QUIC.  The peer should
  retry over HTTP/2.

HTTP_MALFORMED_HAS_BODY (0x09):
: A HAS_BODY frame with a non-empty payload or set flags was received.

HTTP_MALFORMED_HEADERS (0x0A):
: A HEADERS frame has been received with an invalid format.

HTTP_MALFORMED_PRIORITY (0x0B):
: A PRIORITY frame has been received with an invalid format.

HTTP_MALFORMED_SETTINGS (0x0C):
: A SETTINGS frame has been received with an invalid format.

HTTP_MALFORMED_PUSH_PROMISE (0x0D):
: A PUSH_PROMISE frame has been received with an invalid format.

HTTP_MALFORMED_CANCEL_REQUEST (0x0E):
: A PUSH_PROMISE frame has been received with an invalid format.

HTTP_INTERRUPTED_HEADERS (0x0F):
: A HEADERS frame without the End Header Block flag was followed by a frame
  other than HEADERS.

HTTP_MULTIPLE_SETTINGS (0x10):
: More than one SETTINGS frame was received.

HTTP_RST_CONTROL_STREAM (0x11):
: A request, response or push stream was reset.

HTTP_INVALID_STREAM_HEADER (0x12):
: A stream header contained an unknown type or referenced an invalid stream.

HTTP_UNMATCHED_DATA (0x14):
: A data stream referenced an invalid stream.

HTTP_UNMATCHED_PUSH (0x15):
: A push stream referenced a server push request.

HTTP_WRONG_STREAM (0x16):
: A frame was sent on the wrong stream.


# Considerations for Transitioning from HTTP/2

HTTP/QUIC is strongly informed by HTTP/2, and bears many similarities.  This
section points out important differences from HTTP/2 and describes how to map
HTTP/2 extensions into HTTP/QUIC.

## HTTP Frame Types {#h2-frames}

Many framing concepts from HTTP/2 can be elided away on QUIC, because the
transport deals with them. Because frames are already on a stream, they can omit
the stream number. Because frames do not block multiplexing (QUIC's multiplexing
occurs below this layer), the support for variable-maximum-length packets can be
removed. Because stream termination is handled by QUIC, an END_STREAM flag is
not required.

Frame payloads are largely drawn from {{!RFC7540}}. However, QUIC includes many
features (e.g. flow control) which are also present in HTTP/2. In these cases,
the HTTP mapping does not re-implement them. As a result, several HTTP/2 frame
types are not required in HTTP/QUIC. Where an HTTP/2-defined frame is no longer
used, the frame ID has been reserved in order to maximize portability between
HTTP/2 and HTTP/QUIC implementations. However, even equivalent frames between
the two mappings are not identical.

Many of the differences arise from the fact that HTTP/2 provides an absolute
ordering between frames across all streams, while QUIC provides this guarantee
on each stream only.  As a result, if a frame type makes assumptions that frames
from different streams will still be received in the order sent, HTTP/QUIC will
break them.

For example, implicit in the HTTP/2 prioritization scheme is the notion of
in-order delivery of priority changes (i.e., dependency tree mutations): since
operations on the dependency tree such as reparenting a subtree are not
commutative, both sender and receiver must apply them in the same order to
ensure that both sides have a consistent view of the stream dependency tree.
HTTP/2 specifies priority assignments in PRIORITY frames and (optionally) in
HEADERS frames. To achieve in-order delivery of priority changes in HTTP/QUIC,
PRIORITY frames are sent on the connection control stream and the PRIORITY
section is removed from the HEADERS frame.

Other than this issue, frame type HTTP/2 extensions are typically portable to
QUIC simply by replacing Stream 0 in HTTP/2 with Stream 1 in HTTP/QUIC.

Below is a listing of how each HTTP/2 frame type is mapped:

DATA (0x0):
: Instead of DATA frames, HTTP/QUIC uses a separate data stream.  The code point
  for DATA frames is used for the HAS_BODY frame. See {{frame-has-body}}.

HEADERS (0x1):
: As described above, the PRIORITY region of HEADERS is not supported. A
  separate PRIORITY frame MUST be used. Padding is not defined in HTTP/QUIC
  frames.  See {{frame-headers}}.

PRIORITY (0x2):
: As described above, the PRIORITY frame is sent on the connection control
  stream.  See {{frame-priority}}.

RST_STREAM (0x3):
: RST_STREAM frames do not exist, since QUIC provides stream lifecycle
  management.  The same code point is used for the CANCEL_REQUEST frame
  ({{frame-cancel-request}}).

SETTINGS (0x4):
: SETTINGS frames are sent only at the beginning of the connection.  See
  {{frame-settings}} and {{h2-settings}}.

PUSH_PROMISE (0x5):
: The PUSH_PROMISE does not reference the stream that carries the response to
  the pushed request; instead the push stream references the PUSH_PROMISE frame.
  See {{frame-push-promise}}.

PING (0x6):
: PING frames do not exist, since QUIC provides equivalent functionality.

GOAWAY (0x7):
: GOAWAY frames do not exist, since QUIC provides equivalent functionality.

WINDOW_UPDATE (0x8):
: WINDOW_UPDATE frames do not exist, since QUIC provides flow control.

CONTINUATION (0x9):
: CONTINUATION frames do not exist; instead, larger HEADERS/PUSH_PROMISE
  frames than HTTP/2 are permitted, and HEADERS frames can be used in series.

The IANA registry of frame types has been updated in {{iana-frames}} to include
references to the definition for each frame type in HTTP/2 and in HTTP/QUIC.
Frames not defined as available in HTTP/QUIC SHOULD NOT be sent and SHOULD be
ignored as unknown on receipt.

## HTTP/2 SETTINGS Parameters {#h2-settings}

An important difference from HTTP/2 is that settings are sent once, at the
beginning of the connection, and thereafter cannot change.  This eliminates
many corner cases around synchronization of changes.

Some transport-level options that HTTP/2 specifies via the SETTINGS frame are
superseded by QUIC transport parameters in HTTP/QUIC. The HTTP-level options
that are retained in HTTP/QUIC have the same value as in HTTP/2.

Below is a listing of how each HTTP/2 SETTINGS parameter is mapped:

SETTINGS_HEADER_TABLE_SIZE:
: See {{settings-parameters}}.

SETTINGS_ENABLE_PUSH:
: See SETTINGS_DISABLE_PUSH in {{settings-parameters}}.

SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS:
: QUIC requires the maximum number of incoming streams per connection to be
  specified in the initial transport handshake.  Specifying
  SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS in the SETTINGS frame is an error.

SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE:
: QUIC requires both stream and connection flow control window sizes to be
  specified in the initial transport handshake.  Specifying
  SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE in the SETTINGS frame is an error.

SETTINGS_MAX_FRAME_SIZE:
: This setting has no equivalent in HTTP/QUIC.  Specifying it in the SETTINGS
  frame is an error.

SETTINGS_MAX_HEADER_LIST_SIZE:
: See {{settings-parameters}}.

Settings defined by extensions to HTTP/2 MAY be expressed as integers with a
maximum value of 2^32-1, if they are applicable to HTTP/QUIC, but SHOULD have a
specification describing their usage.  Fields for this purpose have been added
to the IANA registry in {{iana-settings}}.

## HTTP/2 Error Codes

QUIC has the same concepts of "stream" and "connection" errors that HTTP/2
provides. However, because the error code space is shared between multiple
components, there is no direct portability of HTTP/2 error codes.

The HTTP/2 error codes defined in Section 7 of {{!RFC7540}} map to QUIC error
codes as follows:

NO_ERROR (0x0):
: QUIC_NO_ERROR

PROTOCOL_ERROR (0x1):
: No single mapping.  See new HTTP_MALFORMED_* error codes defined in
  {{http-error-codes}}.

INTERNAL_ERROR (0x2)
: HTTP_INTERNAL_ERROR in {{http-error-codes}}.

FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR (0x3):
: Not applicable, since QUIC handles flow control.  Would provoke a
  QUIC_FLOW_CONTROL_RECEIVED_TOO_MUCH_DATA from the QUIC layer.

SETTINGS_TIMEOUT (0x4):
: Not applicable, since no acknowledgement of SETTINGS is defined.

STREAM_CLOSED (0x5):
: Not applicable, since QUIC handles stream management.  Would provoke a
  QUIC_STREAM_DATA_AFTER_TERMINATION from the QUIC layer.

FRAME_SIZE_ERROR (0x6)
: No single mapping.  See new error codes defined in {{http-error-codes}}.

REFUSED_STREAM (0x7):
: Not applicable, since QUIC handles stream management.  Would provoke a
  QUIC_TOO_MANY_OPEN_STREAMS from the QUIC layer.

CANCEL (0x8):
: HTTP_REQUEST_CANCELLED in {{http-error-codes}}.

COMPRESSION_ERROR (0x9):
: HTTP_HPACK_DECOMPRESSION_FAILED in {{http-error-codes}}.

CONNECT_ERROR (0xa):
: HTTP_CONNECT_ERROR in {{http-error-codes}}.

ENHANCE_YOUR_CALM (0xb):
: HTTP_EXCESSIVE_LOAD in {{http-error-codes}}.

INADEQUATE_SECURITY (0xc):
: Not applicable, since QUIC is assumed to provide sufficient security on all
  connections.

HTTP_1_1_REQUIRED (0xd):
: HTTP_VERSION_FALLBACK in {{http-error-codes}}.

Error codes defined by HTTP/2 extensions need to be re-registered for HTTP/QUIC
if still applicable.  See {{iana-error-codes}}.

# Security Considerations

The security considerations of HTTP over QUIC should be comparable to those of
HTTP/2.

The modified SETTINGS format contains nested length elements, which could pose
a security risk to an uncautious implementer.  A SETTINGS frame parser MUST
ensure that the length of the frame exactly matches the length of the settings
it contains.

The "Specification" column is renamed to "HTTP/2 Specification" and is only
required if the setting is supported over HTTP/2.

## Error Codes {#iana-error-codes}

This document establishes a registry for HTTP/QUIC error codes.  The
"HTTP/QUIC Error Code" registry manages a 30-bit space.  The "HTTP/QUIC
Error Code" registry operates under the "Expert Review" policy
{{?RFC5226}}.

Registrations for error codes are required to include a description
of the error code.  An expert reviewer is advised to examine new
registrations for possible duplication with existing error codes.
Use of existing registrations is to be encouraged, but not mandated.

New registrations are advised to provide the following information:

Name:
: A name for the error code.  Specifying an error code name is optional.

Code:
: The 30-bit error code value.

Description:
: A brief description of the error code semantics, longer if no detailed
  specification is provided.

Specification:
: An optional reference for a specification that defines the error code.

The entries in the following table are registered by this document.

|-----------------------------------|--------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Name                              | Code   | Description                                  | Specification          |
