# Introduction

QUIC is a multiplexed and secure transport protocol that runs on top of UDP.
QUIC aims to provide a flexible set of features that allow it to be a
general-purpose secure transport for multiple applications.

* Version negotiation

* Low-latency connection establishment

* Authenticated and encrypted header and payload

* Stream multiplexing

* Stream and connection-level flow control

* Connection migration and resilience to NAT rebinding

QUIC implements techniques learned from experience with TCP, SCTP and other
transport protocols.  QUIC uses UDP as substrate so as to not require changes to
legacy client operating systems and middleboxes to be deployable.  QUIC
authenticates all of its headers and encrypts most of the data it exchanges,
including its signaling.  This allows the protocol to evolve without incurring a
dependency on upgrades to middleboxes.  This document describes the core QUIC
protocol, including the conceptual design, wire format, and mechanisms of the
QUIC protocol for connection establishment, stream multiplexing, stream and
connection-level flow control, connection migration, and data reliability.

Accompanying documents describe QUIC's loss detection and congestion control
{{QUIC-RECOVERY}}, and the use of TLS 1.3 for key negotiation {{QUIC-TLS}}.

QUIC version 1 conforms to the protocol invariants in {{QUIC-INVARIANTS}}.


# Conventions and Definitions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 {{!RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}}
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

Definitions of terms that are used in this document:

Client:

: The endpoint initiating a QUIC connection.

Server:

: The endpoint accepting incoming QUIC connections.

Endpoint:

: The client or server end of a connection.

Stream:

: A logical, bi-directional channel of ordered bytes within a QUIC connection.

Connection:

: A conversation between two QUIC endpoints with a single encryption context
  that multiplexes streams within it.

Connection ID:

: An opaque identifier that is used to identify a QUIC connection at an
  endpoint.  Each endpoint sets a value that its peer includes in packets.

QUIC packet:

: A well-formed UDP payload that can be parsed by a QUIC receiver.


## Notational Conventions

Packet and frame diagrams use the format described in Section 3.1 of
{{?RFC2360}}, with the following additional conventions:

\[x\]
: Indicates that x is optional

x (A)
: Indicates that x is A bits long

x (A/B/C) ...
: Indicates that x is one of A, B, or C bits long

x (i) ...
: Indicates that x uses the variable-length encoding in {{integer-encoding}}

x (*) ...
: Indicates that x is variable-length


# Versions {#versions}

QUIC versions are identified using a 32-bit unsigned number.

The version 0x00000000 is reserved to represent version negotiation.  This
version of the specification is identified by the number 0x00000001.

Other versions of QUIC might have different properties to this version.  The
properties of QUIC that are guaranteed to be consistent across all versions of
the protocol are described in {{QUIC-INVARIANTS}}.

Version 0x00000001 of QUIC uses TLS as a cryptographic handshake protocol, as
described in {{QUIC-TLS}}.

Versions with the most significant 16 bits of the version number cleared are
reserved for use in future IETF consensus documents.

Versions that follow the pattern 0x?a?a?a?a are reserved for use in forcing
version negotiation to be exercised.  That is, any version number where the low
four bits of all octets is 1010 (in binary).  A client or server MAY advertise
support for any of these reserved versions.

Reserved version numbers will probably never represent a real protocol; a client
MAY use one of these version numbers with the expectation that the server will
initiate version negotiation; a server MAY advertise support for one of these
versions and can expect that clients ignore the value.

\[\[RFC editor: please remove the remainder of this section before
publication.]]

The version number for the final version of this specification (0x00000001), is
reserved for the version of the protocol that is published as an RFC.

Version numbers used to identify IETF drafts are created by adding the draft
number to 0xff000000.  For example, draft-ietf-quic-transport-13 would be
identified as 0xff00000D.

Implementors are encouraged to register version numbers of QUIC that they
are using for private experimentation on the
[github wiki](https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/wiki/QUIC-Versions).


# Packet Types and Formats

We first describe QUIC's packet types and their formats, since some are
referenced in subsequent mechanisms.

All numeric values are encoded in network byte order (that is, big-endian) and
all field sizes are in bits.  When discussing individual bits of fields, the
least significant bit is referred to as bit 0.  Hexadecimal notation is used for
describing the value of fields.

Any QUIC packet has either a long or a short header, as indicated by the Header
Form bit. Long headers are expected to be used early in the connection before
version negotiation and establishment of 1-RTT keys.  Short headers are minimal
version-specific headers, which are used after version negotiation and 1-RTT
keys are established.

## Long Header {#long-header}

{: #fig-long-header title="Long Header Format"}

Long headers are used for packets that are sent prior to the completion of
version negotiation and establishment of 1-RTT keys. Once both conditions are
met, a sender switches to sending packets using the short header
({{short-header}}).  The long form allows for special packets - such as the
Version Negotiation packet - to be represented in this uniform fixed-length
packet format. A long header contains the following fields:

Header Form:

: The most significant bit (0x80) of octet 0 (the first octet) is set to 1 for
  long headers.

Long Packet Type:

: The remaining seven bits of octet 0 contain the packet type.  This field can
  indicate one of 128 packet types.  The types specified for this version are
  listed in {{long-packet-types}}.

DCIL and SCIL:

: Octet 1 contains the lengths of the two connection ID fields that follow it.
  These lengths are encoded as two 4-bit unsigned integers. The Destination
  Connection ID Length (DCIL) field occupies the 4 high bits of the octet and
  the Source Connection ID Length (SCIL) field occupies the 4 low bits of the
  octet.  An encoded length of 0 indicates that the connection ID is also 0
  octets in length.  Non-zero encoded lengths are increased by 3 to get the full
  length of the connection ID, producing a length between 4 and 18 octets
  inclusive.  For example, an octet with the value 0x50 describes an 8-octet
  Destination Connection ID and a zero-length Source Connection ID.

Destination Connection ID:

: The Destination Connection ID field follows the connection ID lengths and is
  either 0 octets in length or between 4 and 18 octets. {{connection-id}}
  describes the use of this field in more detail.

Source Connection ID:

: The Source Connection ID field follows the Destination Connection ID and is
  either 0 octets in length or between 4 and 18 octets. {{connection-id}}
  describes the use of this field in more detail.

Version:

: The QUIC Version is a 32-bit field that follows the Source Connection
  ID.  This field indicates which version of QUIC is in use and determines how
  the rest of the protocol fields are interpreted.

Packet Number:

: The Packet Number is a 32-bit field that follows the Version.
  {{packet-numbers}} describes the use of packet numbers.

Payload:

: All remaining octets in the packet are the payload of the packet.

The following packet types are defined:

| Type | Name                          | Section                     |
|:-----|:------------------------------|:----------------------------|
| 0x7F | Initial                       | {{packet-initial}}          |
| 0x7E | Retry                         | {{packet-retry}}            |
| 0x7D | Handshake                     | {{packet-handshake}}        |
| 0x7C | 0-RTT Protected               | {{packet-protected}}        |
{: #long-packet-types title="Long Header Packet Types"}

The header form, type, connection ID lengths octet, destination and source
connection IDs, and version fields of a long header packet are
version-independent. The packet number and values for packet types defined in
{{long-packet-types}} are version-specific.  See {{QUIC-INVARIANTS}} for details
on how packets from different versions of QUIC are interpreted.

The interpretation of the fields and the payload are specific to a version and
packet type.  Type-specific semantics for this version are described in the
following sections.

{: #fig-short-header title="Short Header Format"}

The short header can be used after the version and 1-RTT keys are negotiated.
This header form has the following fields:

Header Form:

: The most significant bit (0x80) of octet 0 is set to 0 for the short header.

Key Phase Bit:

: The second bit (0x40) of octet 0 indicates the key phase, which allows a
  recipient of a packet to identify the packet protection keys that are used to
  protect the packet.  See {{QUIC-TLS}} for details.

\[\[Editor's Note: this section should be removed and the bit definitions
changed before this draft goes to the IESG.]]

Third Bit:

: The third bit (0x10) of octet 0 is set to 1.

\[\[Editor's Note: this section should be removed and the bit definitions
changed before this draft goes to the IESG.]]

Fourth Bit:

: The fourth bit (0x10) of octet 0 is set to 1.

\[\[Editor's Note: this section should be removed and the bit definitions
changed before this draft goes to the IESG.]]

Google QUIC Demultipexing Bit:

: The fifth bit (0x8) of octet 0 is set to 0. This allows implementations of
  Google QUIC to distinguish Google QUIC packets from short header packets sent
  by a client because Google QUIC servers expect the connection ID to always be
  present.
  The special interpretation of this bit SHOULD be removed from this
  specification when Google QUIC has finished transitioning to the new header
  format.

Short Packet Type:

: The remaining 3 bits of octet 0 include one of 8 packet types.
  {{short-packet-types}} lists the types that are defined for short packets.

Destination Connection ID:

: The Destination Connection ID is a connection ID that is chosen by the
  intended recipient of the packet.  See {{connection-id}} for more details.

Packet Number:

: The length of the packet number field depends on the packet type.  This field
  can be 1, 2 or 4 octets long depending on the short packet type.

Protected Payload:

: Packets with a short header always include a 1-RTT protected payload.

The packet type in a short header currently determines only the size of the
packet number field.  Additional types can be used to signal the presence of
other fields.

| Type | Packet Number Size |
|:-----|:-------------------|
| 0x0  | 1 octet            |
| 0x1  | 2 octets           |
| 0x2  | 4 octets           |
{: #short-packet-types title="Short Header Packet Types"}

The header form and connection ID field of a short header packet are
version-independent.  The remaining fields are specific to the selected QUIC
version.  See {{QUIC-INVARIANTS}} for details on how packets from different
versions of QUIC are interpreted.


## Version Negotiation Packet {#packet-version}

A Version Negotiation packet is inherently not version-specific, and does not
use the packet headers defined above. Upon receipt by a client, it will appear
to be a packet using the long header, but will be identified as a Version
Negotiation packet based on the Version field.

The Version Negotiation packet is a response to a client packet that contains a
version that is not supported by the server, and is only sent by servers.

The layout of a Version Negotiation packet is:

~~~

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
~~~
{: #version-negotiation-format title="Version Negotiation Packet"}

The value in the Unused field is selected randomly by the server.

The server MUST include the value from the Source Connection ID field of the
packet it receives in the Destination Connection ID field.  The value for Source
Connection ID MUST be copied from the Destination Connection ID of the received
packet, which is initially randomly selected by a client.  Echoing both
connection IDs gives clients some assurance that the server received the packet
and that the Version Negotiation packet was not generated by an off-path
attacker.

The Version field of a Version Negotiation packet MUST be set to 0x00000000.

The remainder of the Version Negotiation packet is a list of 32-bit versions
which the server supports.

A Version Negotiation packet cannot be explicitly acknowledged in an ACK frame
by a client.  Receiving another Initial packet implicitly acknowledges a Version
Negotiation packet.

See {{version-negotiation}} for a description of the version negotiation
process.


## Cryptographic Handshake Packets {#handshake-packets}

Once version negotiation is complete, the cryptographic handshake is used to
agree on cryptographic keys.  The cryptographic handshake is carried in Initial
({{packet-initial}}), Retry ({{packet-retry}}) and Handshake
({{packet-handshake}}) packets.

All these packets use the long header and contain the current QUIC version in
the version field.

In order to prevent tampering by version-unaware middleboxes, handshake packets
are protected with a connection- and version-specific key, as described in
{{QUIC-TLS}}. This protection does not provide confidentiality or integrity
against on-path attackers, but provides some level of protection against
off-path attackers.


### Initial Packet {#packet-initial}

The Initial packet uses long headers with a type value of 0x7F.  It carries the
first cryptographic handshake message sent by the client.

If the client has not previously received a Retry packet from the server, it
populates the Destination Connection ID field with a randomly selected value.
This MUST be at least 8 octets in length.  Until a packet is received from the
server, the client MUST use the same random value unless it also changes the
Source Connection ID (which effectively starts a new connection attempt).  The
randomized Destination Connection ID is used to determine packet protection
keys, but is not included in server packets.

If the client received a Retry packet and is sending a second Initial packet,
then it sets the Destination Connection ID to the value from the Source
Connection ID in the Retry packet.  Changing Destination Connection ID also
results in a change to the keys used to protect the Initial packet.

The client populates the Source Connection ID field with a value of its choosing
and sets the low bits of the ConnID Len field to match.

The first Initial packet that is sent by a client contains a randomized packet
number.  All subsequent packets contain a packet number that is incremented by
one, see ({{packet-numbers}}).

The payload of an Initial packet consists of a STREAM frame (or frames)
for stream 0 containing a cryptographic handshake message, with enough PADDING
frames that the packet is at least 1200 octets (see {{packetization}}).  The
stream in this packet always starts at an offset of 0 (see {{stateless-retry}})
and the complete cryptographic handshake message MUST fit in a single packet
(see {{handshake}}).

The client uses the Initial packet type for any packet that contains an initial
cryptographic handshake message.  This includes all cases where a new packet
containing the initial cryptographic message needs to be created, this includes
the packets sent after receiving a Version Negotiation ({{packet-version}}) or
Retry packet ({{packet-retry}}).


### Retry Packet {#packet-retry}

A Retry packet uses long headers with a type value of 0x7E.  It carries
cryptographic handshake messages and acknowledgments.  It is used by a server
that wishes to perform a stateless retry (see {{stateless-retry}}).

The server populates the Destination Connection ID with the connection ID that
the client included in the Source Connection ID of the Initial packet.  This
might be a zero-length value.

The server includes a connection ID of its choice in the Source Connection ID
field.  The client MUST use this connection ID in the Destination Connection ID
of subsequent packets that it sends.

The packet number field echoes the packet number field from the triggering
client packet.

A Retry packet is never explicitly acknowledged in an ACK frame
by a client.  Receiving another Initial packet implicitly acknowledges a Retry
packet.

After receiving a Retry packet, the client uses a new
Initial packet containing the next cryptographic handshake message.  The client
retains the state of its cryptographic handshake, but discards all transport
state.  The Initial packet that is generated in response to a Retry packet
includes STREAM frames on stream 0 that start again at an offset of 0.

Continuing the cryptographic handshake is necessary to ensure that an attacker
cannot force a downgrade of any cryptographic parameters.  In addition to
continuing the cryptographic handshake, the client MUST remember the results of
any version negotiation that occurred (see {{version-negotiation}}).  The client
MAY also retain any observed RTT or congestion state that it has accumulated for
the flow, but other transport state MUST be discarded.

The payload of the Retry packet contains a single STREAM frame
on stream 0 with offset 0 containing the server's cryptographic stateless retry
material. It MUST NOT contain any other frames. The next STREAM frame sent by
the server will also start at stream offset 0.


### Handshake Packet {#packet-handshake}

A Handshake packet uses long headers with a type value of 0x7D.  It is
used to carry acknowledgments and cryptographic handshake messages from the
server and client.

The Destination Connection ID field in a Handshake packet contains a connection
ID that is chosen by the recipient of the packet; the Source Connection ID
includes the connection ID that the sender of the packet wishes to use (see
{{connection-id}}).

The first Handshake packet sent by a server contains a randomized packet number.
This value is increased for each subsequent packet sent by the server as
described in {{packet-numbers}}.  The client increments the packet number from
its previous packet by one for each Handshake packet that it sends (which might
be an Initial, 0-RTT Protected, or Handshake packet).

Servers MUST NOT send more than three Handshake packets without receiving a
packet from a verified source address.  Source addresses can be verified
through an address validation token, receipt of the final cryptographic message
from the client, or by receiving a valid PATH_RESPONSE frame from the client.

If the server expects to generate more than three Handshake packets in response
to an Initial packet, it SHOULD include a PATH_CHALLENGE frame in each Handshake
packet that it sends.  After receiving at least one valid PATH_RESPONSE frame,
the server can send its remaining Handshake packets. Servers can instead perform
address validation using a Retry packet; this requires less state on the server,
but could involve additional computational effort depending on implementation
choices.

The payload of this packet contains STREAM frames and could contain PADDING,
ACK, PATH_CHALLENGE, or PATH_RESPONSE frames.


## Protected Packets {#packet-protected}

Packets that are protected with 0-RTT keys are sent with long headers; all
packets protected with 1-RTT keys are sent with short headers.  The different
packet types explicitly indicate the encryption level and therefore the keys
that are used to remove packet protection.

Packets protected with 0-RTT keys use a type value of 0x7C.  The connection ID
fields for a 0-RTT packet MUST match the values used in the Initial packet
({{packet-initial}}).

The client can send 0-RTT packets after receiving a Handshake packet
({{packet-handshake}}), if that packet does not complete the handshake.  Even if
the client receives a different connection ID in the Handshake packet, it MUST
continue to use the same Destination Connection ID for 0-RTT packets, see
{{connection-id}}.

The version field for protected packets is the current QUIC version.

The packet number field contains a packet number, which increases with each
packet sent, see {{packet-numbers}} for details.

The payload is protected using authenticated encryption.  {{QUIC-TLS}} describes
packet protection in detail.  After decryption, the plaintext consists of a
sequence of frames, as described in {{frames}}.


## Connection ID {#connection-id}

A connection ID is used to ensure consistent routing of packets.  The long
header contains two connection IDs: the Destination Connection ID is chosen by
the recipient of the packet and is used to provide consistent routing; the
Source Connection ID is used to set the Destination Connection ID used by the
peer.

During the handshake, packets with the long header are used to establish the
connection ID that each endpoint uses.  Each endpoint uses the Source Connection
ID field to specify the connection ID that is used in the Destination Connection
ID field of packets being sent to them.  Upon receiving a packet, each endpoint
sets the Destination Connection ID it sends to match the value of the Source
Connection ID that they receive.

During the handshake, an endpoint might receive multiple packets with the long
header, and thus be given multiple opportunities to update the Destination
Connection ID it sends.  A client MUST only change the value it sends in the
Destination Connection ID in response to the first packet of each type it
receives from the server (Retry or Handshake); a server MUST set its value based
on the Initial packet.  Any additional changes are not permitted; if subsequent
packets of those types include a different Source Connection ID, they MUST be
discarded.  This avoids problems that might arise from stateless processing of
multiple Initial packets producing different connection IDs.

Short headers only include the Destination Connection ID and omit the explicit
length.  The length of the Destination Connection ID field is expected to be
known to endpoints.

Endpoints using a connection-ID based load balancer could agree with the load
balancer on a fixed or minimum length and on an encoding for connection IDs.
This fixed portion could encode an explicit length, which allows the entire
connection ID to vary in length and still be used by the load balancer.

The very first packet sent by a client includes a random value for Destination
Connection ID.  The same value MUST be used for all 0-RTT packets sent on that
connection ({{packet-protected}}).  This randomized value is used to determine
the handshake packet protection keys (see Section 5.2.2 of {{QUIC-TLS}}).

A Version Negotiation ({{packet-version}}) packet MUST use both connection IDs
selected by the client, swapped to ensure correct routing toward the client.


## Packet Numbers {#packet-numbers}

The packet number is an integer in the range 0 to 2^62-1. The value is used in
determining the cryptographic nonce for packet encryption.  Each endpoint
maintains a separate packet number for sending and receiving.  The packet number
for sending MUST increase by at least one after sending any packet, unless
otherwise specified (see {{initial-packet-number}}).

A QUIC endpoint MUST NOT reuse a packet number within the same connection (that
is, under the same cryptographic keys).  If the packet number for sending
reaches 2^62 - 1, the sender MUST close the connection without sending a
CONNECTION_CLOSE frame or any further packets; a server MAY send a Stateless
Reset ({{stateless-reset}}) in response to further packets that it receives.

For the packet header, the number of bits required to represent the packet
number are reduced by including only the least significant bits of the packet
number.  The actual packet number for each packet is reconstructed at the
receiver based on the largest packet number received on a successfully
authenticated packet.

A packet number is decoded by finding the packet number value that is closest to
the next expected packet.  The next expected packet is the highest received
packet number plus one.  For example, if the highest successfully authenticated
packet had a packet number of 0xaa82f30e, then a packet containing a 16-bit
value of 0x1f94 will be decoded as 0xaa831f94.

The sender MUST use a packet number size able to represent more than twice as
large a range than the difference between the largest acknowledged packet and
packet number being sent.  A peer receiving the packet will then correctly
decode the packet number, unless the packet is delayed in transit such that it
arrives after many higher-numbered packets have been received.  An endpoint
SHOULD use a large enough packet number encoding to allow the packet number to
be recovered even if the packet arrives after packets that are sent afterwards.

As a result, the size of the packet number encoding is at least one more than
the base 2 logarithm of the number of contiguous unacknowledged packet numbers,
including the new packet.

For example, if an endpoint has received an acknowledgment for packet 0x6afa2f,
sending a packet with a number of 0x6b4264 requires a 16-bit or larger packet
number encoding; whereas a 32-bit packet number is needed to send a packet with
a number of 0x6bc107.

A Version Negotiation packet ({{packet-version}}) does not include a packet
number.  The Retry packet ({{packet-retry}}) has special rules for populating
the packet number field.


### Initial Packet Number {#initial-packet-number}

The initial value for packet number MUST be selected randomly from a range
between 0 and 2^32 - 1025 (inclusive).  This value is selected so that Initial
and Handshake packets exercise as many possible values for the Packet Number
field as possible.

Limiting the range allows both for loss of packets and for any stateless
exchanges.  Packet numbers are incremented for subsequent packets, but packet
loss and stateless handling can both mean that the first packet sent by an
endpoint isn't necessarily the first packet received by its peer.  The first
packet received by a peer cannot be 2^32 or greater or the recipient will
incorrectly assume a packet number that is 2^32 values lower and discard the
packet.

Use of a secure random number generator {{?RFC4086}} is not necessary for
generating the initial packet number, nor is it necessary that the value be
uniformly distributed.


# Frames and Frame Types {#frames}

The payload of all packets, after removing packet protection, consists of a
sequence of frames, as shown in {{packet-frames}}.  Version Negotiation and
Stateless Reset do not contain frames.

Protected payloads MUST contain at least one frame, and MAY contain multiple

boundary. Each frame begins with a Frame Type byte, indicating its type,
followed by additional type-dependent fields:

Frame types are listed in {{frame-types}}. Note that the Frame Type byte in
STREAM and ACK frames is used to carry other frame-specific flags.  For all
other frames, the Frame Type byte simply identifies the frame.  These frames are

# Life of a Connection

A QUIC connection is a single conversation between two QUIC endpoints.  QUIC's
connection establishment intertwines version negotiation with the cryptographic
and transport handshakes to reduce connection establishment latency, as
described in {{handshake}}.  Once established, a connection may migrate to a
different IP or port at either endpoint, due to NAT rebinding or mobility, as
described in {{migration}}.  Finally a connection may be terminated by either
endpoint, as described in {{termination}}.

## Matching Packets to Connections {#packet-handling}

Incoming packets are classified on receipt.  Packets can either be associated
with an existing connection, or - for servers - potentially create a new
connection.

Hosts try to associate a packet with an existing connection. If the packet has
a Destination Connection ID corresponding to an existing connection, QUIC
processes that packet accordingly. Note that a NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame
({{frame-new-connection-id}}) would associate more than one connection ID with a
connection.

If the Destination Connection ID is zero length and the packet matches the
address/port tuple of a connection where the host did not require connection
IDs, QUIC processes the packet as part of that connection. Endpoints MUST drop
packets with zero-length Destination Connection ID fields if they do not
correspond to a single connection.


### Client Packet Handling {#client-pkt-handling}

Valid packets sent to clients always include a Destination Connection ID that
matches the value the client selects.  Clients that choose to receive
zero-length connection IDs can use the address/port tuple to identify a
connection.  Packets that don't match an existing connection MAY be discarded.

Due to packet reordering or loss, clients might receive packets for a connection
that are encrypted with a key it has not yet computed. Clients MAY drop these
packets, or MAY buffer them in anticipation of later packets that allow it to
compute the key.


### Server Packet Handling {#server-pkt-handling}

If a server receives a packet that has an unsupported version and
sufficient length to be an Initial packet for some version supported
by the server, it SHOULD send a Version Negotiation packet as
described in {{send-vn}}. Servers MAY rate control these packets to
avoid storms of Version Negotiation packets.

The first packet for an unsupported version can use different semantics and
encodings for any version-specific field.  In particular, different packet
protection keys might be used for different versions.  Servers that do not
support a particular version are unlikely to be able to decrypt the content of
the packet.  Servers SHOULD NOT attempt to decode or decrypt a packet from an
unknown version, but instead send a Version Negotiation packet, provided that
the packet is sufficiently long.

Servers MUST drop other packets that contain unsupported versions.

Packets with a supported version, or no version field, are matched to
a connection as described in {{packet-handling}}. If not matched, the
server continues below.

If the packet is an Initial packet fully conforming with the
specification, the server proceeds with the handshake ({{handshake}}).
This commits the server to the version that the client selected.

If a server isn't currently accepting any new connections, it SHOULD send a
Handshake packet containing a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame with error code
SERVER_BUSY.

If the packet is a 0-RTT packet, the server MAY buffer a limited
number of these packets in anticipation of a late-arriving Initial
Packet. Clients are forbidden from sending Handshake packets prior to
receiving a server response, so servers SHOULD ignore any such packets.

Servers MUST drop incoming packets under all other circumstances. They
SHOULD send a Stateless Reset ({{stateless-reset}}) if a connection ID
is present in the header.

## Version Negotiation

Version negotiation ensures that client and server agree to a QUIC version
that is mutually supported. A server sends a Version Negotiation packet in
response to each packet that might initiate a new connection, see
{{packet-handling}} for details.

The size of the first packet sent by a client will determine whether a server
sends a Version Negotiation packet. Clients that support multiple QUIC
versions SHOULD pad their Initial packets to reflect the largest minimum
Initial packet size of all their versions. This ensures that that the server
responds if there are any mutually supported versions.

### Sending Version Negotiation Packets {#send-vn}

If the version selected by the client is not acceptable to the server, the
server responds with a Version Negotiation packet (see {{packet-version}}).
This includes a list of versions that the server will accept.

This system allows a server to process packets with unsupported versions without
retaining state.  Though either the Initial packet or the Version Negotiation
packet that is sent in response could be lost, the client will send new packets
until it successfully receives a response or it abandons the connection attempt.


### Handling Version Negotiation Packets {#handle-vn}

When the client receives a Version Negotiation packet, it first checks that the
Destination and Source Connection ID fields match the Source and Destination
Connection ID fields in a packet that the client sent.  If this check fails, the
packet MUST be discarded.

Once the Version Negotiation packet is determined to be valid, the client then
selects an acceptable protocol version from the list provided by the server.
The client then attempts to create a connection using that version.  Though the
contents of the Client Initial packet the client sends might not change in
response to version negotiation, a client MUST increase the packet number it
uses on every packet it sends.  Packets MUST continue to use long headers and
MUST include the new negotiated protocol version.

The client MUST use the long header format and include its selected version on
all packets until it has 1-RTT keys and it has received a packet from the server
which is not a Version Negotiation packet.

A client MUST NOT change the version it uses unless it is in response to a
Version Negotiation packet from the server.  Once a client receives a packet
from the server which is not a Version Negotiation packet, it MUST discard other
Version Negotiation packets on the same connection.  Similarly, a client MUST
ignore a Version Negotiation packet if it has already received and acted on a
Version Negotiation packet.

A client MUST ignore a Version Negotiation packet that lists the client's chosen
version.

Version negotiation packets have no cryptographic protection. The result of the
negotiation MUST be revalidated as part of the cryptographic handshake (see
{{version-validation}}).


### Using Reserved Versions

For a server to use a new version in the future, clients must correctly handle
unsupported versions. To help ensure this, a server SHOULD include a reserved
version (see {{versions}}) while generating a Version Negotiation packet.

The design of version negotiation permits a server to avoid maintaining state
for packets that it rejects in this fashion. The validation of version
negotiation (see {{version-validation}}) only validates the result of version
negotiation, which is the same no matter which reserved version was sent.
A server MAY therefore send different reserved version numbers in the Version
Negotiation Packet and in its transport parameters.

A client MAY send a packet using a reserved version number.  This can be used to
solicit a list of supported versions from a server.


## Cryptographic and Transport Handshake {#handshake}

QUIC relies on a combined cryptographic and transport handshake to minimize
connection establishment latency.  QUIC allocates stream 0 for the cryptographic
handshake.  Version 0x00000001 of QUIC uses TLS 1.3 as described in
{{QUIC-TLS}}; a different QUIC version number could indicate that a different
cryptographic handshake protocol is in use.

QUIC provides this stream with reliable, ordered delivery of data.  In return,
the cryptographic handshake provides QUIC with:

* authenticated key exchange, where

   * a server is always authenticated,

   * a client is optionally authenticated,

   * every connection produces distinct and unrelated keys,

   * keying material is usable for packet protection for both 0-RTT and 1-RTT
     packets, and

   * 1-RTT keys have forward secrecy

* authenticated values for the transport parameters of the peer (see
  {{transport-parameters}})

* authenticated confirmation of version negotiation (see {{version-validation}})

* authenticated negotiation of an application protocol (TLS uses ALPN
  {{?RFC7301}} for this purpose)

* for the server, the ability to carry data that provides assurance that the
  client can receive packets that are addressed with the transport address that
  is claimed by the client (see {{address-validation}})

The initial cryptographic handshake message MUST be sent in a single packet.
Any second attempt that is triggered by address validation MUST also be sent
within a single packet.  This avoids having to reassemble a message from
multiple packets.  Reassembling messages requires that a server maintain state
prior to establishing a connection, exposing the server to a denial of service
risk.

The first client packet of the cryptographic handshake protocol MUST fit within
a 1232 octet QUIC packet payload.  This includes overheads that reduce the space
available to the cryptographic handshake protocol.

Details of how TLS is integrated with QUIC is provided in more detail in
{{QUIC-TLS}}.


## Transport Parameters

During connection establishment, both endpoints make authenticated declarations
of their transport parameters.  These declarations are made unilaterally by each
endpoint.  Endpoints are required to comply with the restrictions implied by
these parameters; the description of each parameter includes rules for its
handling.

The format of the transport parameters is the TransportParameters struct from
{{figure-transport-parameters}}.  This is described using the presentation
language from Section 3 of {{!I-D.ietf-tls-tls13}}.

~~~
   uint32 QuicVersion;

   enum {
      initial_max_stream_data(0),
      initial_max_data(1),
      initial_max_stream_id_bidi(2),
      idle_timeout(3),
      max_packet_size(5),
      stateless_reset_token(6),
      ack_delay_exponent(7),
      initial_max_stream_id_uni(8),
      (65535)
   } TransportParameterId;

   struct {
      TransportParameterId parameter;
      opaque value<0..2^16-1>;
   } TransportParameter;

   struct {
      select (Handshake.msg_type) {
         case client_hello:
            QuicVersion initial_version;

         case encrypted_extensions:
            QuicVersion negotiated_version;
            QuicVersion supported_versions<4..2^8-4>;
      };
      TransportParameter parameters<22..2^16-1>;
   } TransportParameters;
~~~
{: #figure-transport-parameters title="Definition of TransportParameters"}

The `extension_data` field of the quic_transport_parameters extension defined in
{{QUIC-TLS}} contains a TransportParameters value.  TLS encoding rules are
therefore used to encode the transport parameters.

QUIC encodes transport parameters into a sequence of octets, which are then
included in the cryptographic handshake.  Once the handshake completes, the
transport parameters declared by the peer are available.  Each endpoint
validates the value provided by its peer.  In particular, version negotiation
MUST be validated (see {{version-validation}}) before the connection
establishment is considered properly complete.

Definitions for each of the defined transport parameters are included in
{{transport-parameter-definitions}}.  Any given parameter MUST appear
at most once in a given transport parameters extension.  An endpoint MUST
treat receipt of duplicate transport parameters as a connection error of
type TRANSPORT_PARAMETER_ERROR.


### Transport Parameter Definitions

An endpoint MUST include the following parameters in its encoded
TransportParameters:

initial_max_stream_data (0x0000):

: The initial stream maximum data parameter contains the initial value for the
  maximum data that can be sent on any newly created stream.  This parameter is
  encoded as an unsigned 32-bit integer in units of octets.  This is equivalent
  to an implicit MAX_STREAM_DATA frame ({{frame-max-stream-data}}) being sent on
  all streams immediately after opening.

initial_max_data (0x0001):

: The initial maximum data parameter contains the initial value for the maximum
  amount of data that can be sent on the connection.  This parameter is encoded
  as an unsigned 32-bit integer in units of octets.  This is equivalent to
  sending a MAX_DATA ({{frame-max-data}}) for the connection immediately after
  completing the handshake.

idle_timeout (0x0003):

: The idle timeout is a value in seconds that is encoded as an unsigned 16-bit
  integer.  The maximum value is 600 seconds (10 minutes).

A server MUST include the following transport parameters:

stateless_reset_token (0x0006):

: The Stateless Reset Token is used in verifying a stateless reset, see
  {{stateless-reset}}.  This parameter is a sequence of 16 octets.

A client MUST NOT include a stateless reset token.  A server MUST treat receipt
of a stateless_reset_token transport parameter as a connection error of type
TRANSPORT_PARAMETER_ERROR.

An endpoint MAY use the following transport parameters:

initial_max_stream_id_bidi (0x0002):

: The initial maximum stream ID parameter contains the initial maximum stream
  number the peer may initiate for bidirectional streams, encoded as an unsigned
  32-bit integer.  This value MUST be a valid bidirectional stream ID for a
  peer-initiated stream (that is, the two least significant bits are set to 0 by
  a server and to 1 by a client).  If an invalid value is provided, the
  recipient MUST generate a connection error of type TRANSPORT_PARAMETER_ERROR.
  Setting this parameter is equivalent to sending a MAX_STREAM_ID
  ({{frame-max-stream-id}}) immediately after completing the handshake.  The
  maximum bidirectional stream ID is set to 0 if this parameter is absent,
  preventing the creation of new bidirectional streams until a MAX_STREAM_ID
  frame is sent.  Note that a default value of 0 does not prevent the
  cryptographic handshake stream (that is, stream 0) from being used.

initial_max_stream_id_uni (0x0008):

: The initial maximum stream ID parameter contains the initial maximum stream
  number the peer may initiate for unidirectional streams, encoded as an
  unsigned 32-bit integer.  The value MUST be a valid unidirectional ID for the
  recipient (that is, the two least significant bits are set to 2 by a server
  and to 3 by a client).  If an invalid value is provided, the recipient MUST
  generate a connection error of type TRANSPORT_PARAMETER_ERROR.  Setting this
  parameter is equivalent to sending a MAX_STREAM_ID ({{frame-max-stream-id}})
  immediately after completing the handshake.  The maximum unidirectional stream
  ID is set to 0 if this parameter is absent, preventing the creation of new
  unidirectional streams until a MAX_STREAM_ID frame is sent.

max_packet_size (0x0005):

: The maximum packet size parameter places a limit on the size of packets that
  the endpoint is willing to receive, encoded as an unsigned 16-bit integer.
  This indicates that packets larger than this limit will be dropped.  The
  default for this parameter is the maximum permitted UDP payload of 65527.
  Values below 1200 are invalid.  This limit only applies to protected packets
  ({{packet-protected}}).

ack_delay_exponent (0x0007):

: An 8-bit unsigned integer value indicating an exponent used to decode the ACK
  Delay field in the ACK frame, see {{frame-ack}}.  If this value is absent, a
  default value of 3 is assumed (indicating a multiplier of 8).  The default
  value is also used for ACK frames that are sent in Initial, Handshake, and
  Retry packets.  Values above 20 are invalid.


### Values of Transport Parameters for 0-RTT {#zerortt-parameters}

A client that attempts to send 0-RTT data MUST remember the transport parameters
used by the server.  The transport parameters that the server advertises during
connection establishment apply to all connections that are resumed using the
keying material established during that handshake.  Remembered transport
parameters apply to the new connection until the handshake completes and new
transport parameters from the server can be provided.

A server can remember the transport parameters that it advertised, or store an
integrity-protected copy of the values in the ticket and recover the information
when accepting 0-RTT data.  A server uses the transport parameters in
determining whether to accept 0-RTT data.

A server MAY accept 0-RTT and subsequently provide different values for
transport parameters for use in the new connection.  If 0-RTT data is accepted
by the server, the server MUST NOT reduce any limits or alter any values that
might be violated by the client with its 0-RTT data.  In particular, a server
that accepts 0-RTT data MUST NOT set values for initial_max_data or
initial_max_stream_data that are smaller than the remembered value of those
parameters.  Similarly, a server MUST NOT reduce the value of
initial_max_stream_id_bidi or initial_max_stream_id_uni.

Omitting or setting a zero value for certain transport parameters can result in
0-RTT data being enabled, but not usable.  The following transport parameters
SHOULD be set to non-zero values for 0-RTT: initial_max_stream_id_bidi,
initial_max_stream_id_uni, initial_max_data, initial_max_stream_data.

A server MUST reject 0-RTT data or even abort a handshake if the implied values
for transport parameters cannot be supported.


### New Transport Parameters

New transport parameters can be used to negotiate new protocol behavior.  An
endpoint MUST ignore transport parameters that it does not support.  Absence of
a transport parameter therefore disables any optional protocol feature that is
negotiated using the parameter.

New transport parameters can be registered according to the rules in
{{iana-transport-parameters}}.


### Version Negotiation Validation {#version-validation}

Though the cryptographic handshake has integrity protection, two forms of QUIC
version downgrade are possible.  In the first, an attacker replaces the QUIC
version in the Initial packet.  In the second, a fake Version Negotiation packet
is sent by an attacker.  To protect against these attacks, the transport
parameters include three fields that encode version information.  These
parameters are used to retroactively authenticate the choice of version (see
{{version-negotiation}}).

The cryptographic handshake provides integrity protection for the negotiated
version as part of the transport parameters (see {{transport-parameters}}).  As
a result, attacks on version negotiation by an attacker can be detected.

The client includes the initial_version field in its transport parameters.  The
initial_version is the version that the client initially attempted to use.  If
the server did not send a Version Negotiation packet {{packet-version}}, this
will be identical to the negotiated_version field in the server transport
parameters.

A server that processes all packets in a stateful fashion can remember how
version negotiation was performed and validate the initial_version value.

A server that does not maintain state for every packet it receives (i.e., a
stateless server) uses a different process. If the initial_version matches the
version of QUIC that is in use, a stateless server can accept the value.

If the initial_version is different from the version of QUIC that is in use, a
stateless server MUST check that it would have sent a Version Negotiation packet
if it had received a packet with the indicated initial_version.  If a server
would have accepted the version included in the initial_version and the value
differs from the QUIC version that is in use, the server MUST terminate the
connection with a VERSION_NEGOTIATION_ERROR error.

The server includes both the version of QUIC that is in use and a list of the
QUIC versions that the server supports.

The negotiated_version field is the version that is in use.  This MUST be set by
the server to the value that is on the Initial packet that it accepts (not an
Initial packet that triggers a Retry or Version Negotiation packet).  A client
that receives a negotiated_version that does not match the version of QUIC that
is in use MUST terminate the connection with a VERSION_NEGOTIATION_ERROR error
code.

The server includes a list of versions that it would send in any version
negotiation packet ({{packet-version}}) in the supported_versions field.  The
server populates this field even if it did not send a version negotiation
packet.

The client validates that the negotiated_version is included in the
supported_versions list and - if version negotiation was performed - that it
would have selected the negotiated version.  A client MUST terminate the
connection with a VERSION_NEGOTIATION_ERROR error code if the current QUIC
version is not listed in the supported_versions list.  A client MUST terminate
with a VERSION_NEGOTIATION_ERROR error code if version negotiation occurred but
it would have selected a different version based on the value of the
supported_versions list.

When an endpoint accepts multiple QUIC versions, it can potentially interpret
transport parameters as they are defined by any of the QUIC versions it
supports.  The version field in the QUIC packet header is authenticated using
transport parameters.  The position and the format of the version fields in
transport parameters MUST either be identical across different QUIC versions, or
be unambiguously different to ensure no confusion about their interpretation.
One way that a new format could be introduced is to define a TLS extension with
a different codepoint.


## Stateless Retries {#stateless-retry}

A server can process an initial cryptographic handshake messages from a client
without committing any state. This allows a server to perform address validation
({{address-validation}}, or to defer connection establishment costs.

A server that generates a response to an initial packet without retaining
connection state MUST use the Retry packet ({{packet-retry}}).  This packet
causes a client to reset its transport state and to continue the connection
attempt with new connection state while maintaining the state of the
cryptographic handshake.

A server MUST NOT send multiple Retry packets in response to a client handshake
packet.  Thus, any cryptographic handshake message that is sent MUST fit within
a single packet.

In TLS, the Retry packet type is used to carry the HelloRetryRequest message.


## Proof of Source Address Ownership {#address-validation}

Transport protocols commonly spend a round trip checking that a client owns the
transport address (IP and port) that it claims.  Verifying that a client can
receive packets sent to its claimed transport address protects against spoofing
of this information by malicious clients.

This technique is used primarily to avoid QUIC from being used for traffic
amplification attack.  In such an attack, a packet is sent to a server with
spoofed source address information that identifies a victim.  If a server
generates more or larger packets in response to that packet, the attacker can
use the server to send more data toward the victim than it would be able to send
on its own.

Several methods are used in QUIC to mitigate this attack.  Firstly, the initial
handshake packet is padded to at least 1200 octets.  This allows a server to
send a similar amount of data without risking causing an amplification attack
toward an unproven remote address.

A server eventually confirms that a client has received its messages when the
cryptographic handshake successfully completes.  This might be insufficient,
either because the server wishes to avoid the computational cost of completing
the handshake, or it might be that the size of the packets that are sent during
the handshake is too large.  This is especially important for 0-RTT, where the
server might wish to provide application data traffic - such as a response to a
request - in response to the data carried in the early data from the client.

To send additional data prior to completing the cryptographic handshake, the
server then needs to validate that the client owns the address that it claims.

Source address validation is therefore performed during the establishment of a
connection.  TLS provides the tools that support the feature, but basic
validation is performed by the core transport protocol.

A different type of source address validation is performed after a connection
migration, see {{migrate-validate}}.


### Client Address Validation Procedure

QUIC uses token-based address validation.  Any time the server wishes to
validate a client address, it provides the client with a token.  As long as the
token cannot be easily guessed (see {{token-integrity}}), if the client is able
to return that token, it proves to the server that it received the token.

During the processing of the cryptographic handshake messages from a client, TLS
will request that QUIC make a decision about whether to proceed based on the
information it has.  TLS will provide QUIC with any token that was provided by
the client.  For an initial packet, QUIC can decide to abort the connection,
allow it to proceed, or request address validation.

If QUIC decides to request address validation, it provides the cryptographic
handshake with a token.  The contents of this token are consumed by the server
that generates the token, so there is no need for a single well-defined format.
A token could include information about the claimed client address (IP and
port), a timestamp, and any other supplementary information the server will need
to validate the token in the future.

The cryptographic handshake is responsible for enacting validation by sending
the address validation token to the client.  A legitimate client will include a
copy of the token when it attempts to continue the handshake.  The cryptographic
handshake extracts the token then asks QUIC a second time whether the token is
acceptable.  In response, QUIC can either abort the connection or permit it to
proceed.

A connection MAY be accepted without address validation - or with only limited
validation - but a server SHOULD limit the data it sends toward an unvalidated
address.  Successful completion of the cryptographic handshake implicitly
provides proof that the client has received packets from the server.


### Address Validation on Session Resumption

A server MAY provide clients with an address validation token during one
connection that can be used on a subsequent connection.  Address validation is
especially important with 0-RTT because a server potentially sends a significant
amount of data to a client in response to 0-RTT data.

A different type of token is needed when resuming.  Unlike the token that is
created during a handshake, there might be some time between when the token is
created and when the token is subsequently used.  Thus, a resumption token
SHOULD include an expiration time.  It is also unlikely that the client port
number is the same on two different connections; validating the port is
therefore unlikely to be successful.

This token can be provided to the cryptographic handshake immediately after
establishing a connection.  QUIC might also generate an updated token if
significant time passes or the client address changes for any reason (see
{{migration}}).  The cryptographic handshake is responsible for providing the
client with the token.  In TLS the token is included in the ticket that is used
for resumption and 0-RTT, which is carried in a NewSessionTicket message.


### Address Validation Token Integrity {#token-integrity}

An address validation token MUST be difficult to guess.  Including a large
enough random value in the token would be sufficient, but this depends on the
server remembering the value it sends to clients.

A token-based scheme allows the server to offload any state associated with
validation to the client.  For this design to work, the token MUST be covered by
integrity protection against modification or falsification by clients.  Without
integrity protection, malicious clients could generate or guess values for
tokens that would be accepted by the server.  Only the server requires access to
the integrity protection key for tokens.

In TLS the address validation token is often bundled with the information that
TLS requires, such as the resumption secret.  In this case, adding integrity
protection can be delegated to the cryptographic handshake protocol, avoiding
redundant protection.  If integrity protection is delegated to the cryptographic
handshake, an integrity failure will result in immediate cryptographic handshake
failure.  If integrity protection is performed by QUIC, QUIC MUST abort the
connection if the integrity check fails with a PROTOCOL_VIOLATION error code.


## Connection Migration {#migration}

A QUIC connection can be identified using the Destination Connection ID included
in packets.  QUIC's consistent connection ID allows connections to survive
changes to the client's IP and/or port, such as those caused by client or server
migrating to a new network.  Connection migration allows a client to retain any
shared state with a connection when they move networks.  This includes state
that can be hard to recover such as outstanding requests, which might otherwise
be lost with no easy way to retry them.

An endpoint that receives packets that contain a source IP address and port that
has not yet been used can start sending new packets with those as a destination
IP address and port.  Packets exchanged between endpoints can then follow the
new path.

Due to variations in path latency or packet reordering, packets from different
source addresses might be reordered.  The packet with the highest packet number
MUST be used to determine which path to use.  Endpoints also need to be prepared
to receive packets from an older source address.

An endpoint MUST validate that its peer can receive packets at the new address
before sending any significant quantity of data to that address, or it risks
being used for denial of service.  See {{migrate-validate}} for details.


### Privacy Implications of Connection Migration {#migration-linkability}

Using a stable connection ID on multiple network paths allows a passive observer
to correlate activity between those paths.  An endpoint that moves between
networks might not wish to have their activity correlated by any entity other
than a server. The NEW_CONNECTION_ID message can be sent by both endpoints to
provide an unlinkable connection ID for use in case a peer wishes to explicitly
break linkability between two points of network attachment.

An endpoint might need to send packets on multiple networks without receiving
any response from its peer.  To ensure that the endpoint is not linkable
across each of these changes, a new connection ID and packet number gap are
needed for each network.  To support this, each endpoint sends multiple
NEW_CONNECTION_ID messages.  Each NEW_CONNECTION_ID is marked with a sequence
number.  Connection IDs MUST be used in the order in which they are numbered.

An endpoint that does not require the use of a connection ID should not request
that its peer use a connection ID.  Such an endpoint does not need to provide
new connection IDs using the NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame.

An endpoint which wishes to break linkability upon changing networks MUST use
the connection ID provided by its peer as well as incrementing the packet
sequence number by an externally unpredictable value computed as described in
{{packet-number-gap}}. Packet number gaps are cumulative.  An endpoint might
skip connection IDs, but it MUST ensure that it applies the associated packet
number gaps for connection IDs that it skips in addition to the packet number
gap associated with the connection ID that it does use.

An endpoint that receives a packet that is marked with a new connection ID
recovers the packet number by adding the cumulative packet number gap to its
expected packet number.  An endpoint MUST discard packets that contain a smaller
gap than it advertised.

An endpoint that receives a successfully authenticated packet with a previously
unused connection ID MUST use the next available connection ID for any packets
it sends to that address.  To avoid changing connection IDs multiple times when
packets arrive out of order, endpoints MUST change only in response to a packet
that increases the largest received packet number.  Failing to do this could
allow for use of that connection ID to link activity on new paths.  There is no
need to move to a new connection ID if the address of a peer changes without
also changing the connection ID.

For instance, a server might provide a packet number gap of 7 associated with a
new connection ID.  If the server received packet 10 using the previous
connection ID, it should expect packets on the new connection ID to start at 18.
A packet with the new connection ID and a packet number of 17 is discarded as
being in error.


#### Packet Number Gap

In order to avoid linkage, the packet number gap MUST be externally
indistinguishable from random. The packet number gap for a connection
ID with sequence number is computed by encoding the sequence number
as a 32-bit integer in big-endian format, and then computing:

~~~
Gap = HKDF-Expand-Label(packet_number_secret,
                        "QUIC packet sequence gap", sequence, 4)
~~~

The output of HKDF-Expand-Label is interpreted as a big-endian
number. "packet_number_secret" is derived from the TLS key exchange,
as described in Section 5.6 of {{QUIC-TLS}}.


### Address Validation for Migrated Connections {#migrate-validate}

An endpoint that receives a packet from a new remote IP address and port (or
just a new remote port) on packets from its peer is likely seeing a connection
migration at the peer.

However, it is also possible that the peer is spoofing its source address in
order to cause the endpoint to send excessive amounts of data to an unwilling
host.  If the endpoint sends significantly more data than the peer, connection
migration might be used to amplify the volume of data that an attacker can
generate toward a victim.

Thus, when seeing a new remote transport address, an endpoint MUST verify that
its peer can receive and respond to packets at that new address.  By providing
copies of the data that it receives, the peer proves that it is receiving
packets at the new address and consents to receive data.

Prior to validating the new remote address, and endpoint MUST limit the amount
of data and packets that it sends to its peer.  At a minimum, this needs to
consider the possibility that packets are sent without congestion feedback.

Once a connection is established, address validation is relatively simple (see
{{address-validation}} for the process that is used during the handshake).  An
endpoint validates a remote address by sending a PATH_CHALLENGE frame containing
a payload that is hard to guess.  This frame MUST be sent in a packet that is
sent to the new address.  Once a PATH_RESPONSE frame containing the same payload
is received, the address is considered to be valid.

The new address is not considered valid until a PATH_RESPONSE frame containing
the same payload is received, even if the packet containing the PATH_CHALLENGE
frame is acknowledged.

The PATH_RESPONSE frame can use any path on its return.

An endpoint MAY send multiple PATH_CHALLENGE frames to handle packet loss or to
make additional measurements on a new network path.

An endpoint MUST use fresh random data in every PATH_CHALLENGE frame so that it
can associate the peer's response with the causative PATH_CHALLENGE.

If the PATH_CHALLENGE frame is determined to be lost, a new PATH_CHALLENGE frame
SHOULD be generated.  This PATH_CHALLENGE frame MUST include new data that is
similarly difficult to guess.

If validation of the new remote address fails, after allowing enough time for
recovering from possible loss of packets carrying PATH_CHALLENGE and
PATH_RESPONSE frames, the endpoint MUST terminate the connection.  When setting
this timer, implementations are cautioned that the new path could have a longer
round trip time than the original.  The endpoint MUST NOT send a
CONNECTION_CLOSE frame in this case; it has to assume that the remote peer
cannot want to receive any more packets.

If the remote address is validated successfully, the endpoint MAY increase the
rate that it sends on the new path using the state from the previous path.  The
capacity available on the new path might not be the same as the old path.  An
endpoint MUST NOT restore its send rate unless it is reasonably sure that the
path is the same as the previous path.  For instance, a change in only port
number is likely indicative of a rebinding in a middlebox and not a complete
change in path.  This determination likely depends on heuristics, which could be
imperfect; if the new path capacity is significantly reduced, ultimately this
relies on the congestion controller responding to congestion signals and reduce
send rates appropriately.

After verifying an address, the endpoint SHOULD update any address validation
tokens ({{address-validation}}) that it has issued to its peer if those are no
longer valid based on the changed address.

Address validation using the PATH_CHALLENGE frame MAY be used at any time by
either peer.  For instance, an endpoint might check that a peer is still in
possession of its address after a period of quiescence.

Upon seeing a connection migration, an endpoint that sees a new address MUST
abandon any address validation it is performing with other addresses on the
expectation that the validation is likely to fail.  Abandoning address
validation primarily means not closing the connection when a PATH_RESPONSE frame
is not received, but it could also mean ceasing subsequent transmissions of the
PATH_CHALLENGE frame.  An endpoint MUST ignore any subsequently received
PATH_RESPONSE frames from that address.


## Spurious Connection Migrations

A connection migration could be triggered by an attacker that is able to capture
and forward a packet such that it arrives before the legitimate copy of that
packet.  Such a packet will appear to be a legitimate connection migration and
the legitimate copy will be dropped as a duplicate.

After a spurious migration, validation of the source address will fail because
the entity at the source address does not have the necessary cryptographic keys
to read or respond to the PATH_CHALLENGE frame that is sent to it, even if it
wanted to.  Such a spurious connection migration could result in the connection
being dropped when the source address validation fails.  This grants an attacker
the ability to terminate the connection.

Receipt of packets with higher packet numbers from the legitimate address will
trigger another connection migration.  This will cause the validation of the
address of the spurious migration to be abandoned.

To ensure that a peer sends packets from the legitimate address before the
validation of the new address can fail, an endpoint SHOULD attempt to validate
the old remote address before attempting to validate the new address.  If the
connection migration is spurious, then the legitimate address will be used to
respond and the connection will migrate back to the old address.

As with any address validation, packets containing a PATH_CHALLENGE frame
validating an address MUST be sent to the address being validated.
Consequently, during a migration of a peer, an endpoint could be sending to
multiple remote addresses.

An endpoint MAY abandon address validation for an address that it considers to
be already valid.  That is, if successive connection migrations occur in quick
succession with the final remote address being identical to the initial remote
address, the endpoint MAY abandon address validation for that address.


## Connection Termination {#termination}

Connections should remain open until they become idle for a pre-negotiated
period of time.  A QUIC connection, once established, can be terminated in one
of three ways:

* idle timeout ({{idle-timeout}})
* immediate close ({{immediate-close}})
* stateless reset ({{stateless-reset}})


### Closing and Draining Connection States {#draining}

The closing and draining connection states exist to ensure that connections
close cleanly and that delayed or reordered packets are properly discarded.
These states SHOULD persist for three times the current Retransmission Timeout
(RTO) interval as defined in {{QUIC-RECOVERY}}.

An endpoint enters a closing period after initiating an immediate close
({{immediate-close}}).  While closing, an endpoint MUST NOT send packets unless
they contain a CONNECTION_CLOSE or APPLICATION_CLOSE frame (see
{{immediate-close}} for details).

In the closing state, only a packet containing a closing frame can be sent.  An
endpoint retains only enough information to generate a packet containing a
closing frame and to identify packets as belonging to the connection.  The
connection ID and QUIC version is sufficient information to identify packets for
a closing connection; an endpoint can discard all other connection state.  An
endpoint MAY retain packet protection keys for incoming packets to allow it to
read and process a closing frame.

The draining state is entered once an endpoint receives a signal that its peer
is closing or draining.  While otherwise identical to the closing state, an
endpoint in the draining state MUST NOT send any packets.  Retaining packet
protection keys is unnecessary once a connection is in the draining state.

An endpoint MAY transition from the closing period to the draining period if it
can confirm that its peer is also closing or draining.  Receiving a closing
frame is sufficient confirmation, as is receiving a stateless reset.  The
draining period SHOULD end when the closing period would have ended.  In other
words, the endpoint can use the same end time, but cease retransmission of the
closing packet.

Disposing of connection state prior to the end of the closing or draining period
could cause delayed or reordered packets to be handled poorly.  Endpoints that
have some alternative means to ensure that late-arriving packets on the
connection do not create QUIC state, such as those that are able to close the
UDP socket, MAY use an abbreviated draining period which can allow for faster
resource recovery.  Servers that retain an open socket for accepting new
connections SHOULD NOT exit the closing or draining period early.

Once the closing or draining period has ended, an endpoint SHOULD discard all
connection state.  This results in new packets on the connection being handled
generically.  For instance, an endpoint MAY send a stateless reset in response
to any further incoming packets.

The draining and closing periods do not apply when a stateless reset
({{stateless-reset}}) is sent.

An endpoint is not expected to handle key updates when it is closing or
draining.  A key update might prevent the endpoint from moving from the closing
state to draining, but it otherwise has no impact.

An endpoint could receive packets from a new source address, indicating a
connection migration ({{migration}}), while in the closing period. An endpoint
in the closing state MUST strictly limit the number of packets it sends to this
new address as though the address were not validated (see {{migrate-validate}}).
A server in the closing state MAY instead choose to discard packets received
from a new source address.


### Idle Timeout

A connection that remains idle for longer than the idle timeout (see
{{transport-parameter-definitions}}) is closed.  A connection enters the
draining state when the idle timeout expires.

The time at which an idle timeout takes effect won't be perfectly synchronized
on both endpoints.  An endpoint that sends packets near the end of an idle
period could have those packets discarded if its peer enters the draining state
before the packet is received.


### Immediate Close

An endpoint sends a closing frame, either CONNECTION_CLOSE or APPLICATION_CLOSE,
to terminate the connection immediately.  Either closing frame causes all
streams to immediately become closed; open streams can be assumed to be
implicitly reset.

After sending a closing frame, endpoints immediately enter the closing state.
During the closing period, an endpoint that sends a closing frame SHOULD respond
to any packet that it receives with another packet containing a closing frame.
To minimize the state that an endpoint maintains for a closing connection,
endpoints MAY send the exact same packet.  However, endpoints SHOULD limit the
number of packets they generate containing a closing frame.  For instance, an
endpoint could progressively increase the number of packets that it receives
before sending additional packets or increase the time between packets.

Note:

: Allowing retransmission of a packet contradicts other advice in this document
  that recommends the creation of new packet numbers for every packet.  Sending
  new packet numbers is primarily of advantage to loss recovery and congestion
  control, which are not expected to be relevant for a closed connection.
  Retransmitting the final packet requires less state.

After receiving a closing frame, endpoints enter the draining state.  An
endpoint that receives a closing frame MAY send a single packet containing a
closing frame before entering the draining state, using a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame
and a NO_ERROR code if appropriate.  An endpoint MUST NOT send further packets,
which could result in a constant exchange of closing frames until the closing
period on either peer ended.

An immediate close can be used after an application protocol has arranged to
close a connection.  This might be after the application protocols negotiates a
graceful shutdown.  The application protocol exchanges whatever messages that
are needed to cause both endpoints to agree to close the connection, after which
the application requests that the connection be closed.  The application
protocol can use an APPLICATION_CLOSE message with an appropriate error code to
signal closure.


### Stateless Reset {#stateless-reset}

A stateless reset is provided as an option of last resort for a server that does
not have access to the state of a connection.  A server crash or outage might
result in clients continuing to send data to a server that is unable to properly
continue the connection.  A server that wishes to communicate a fatal connection
error MUST use a closing frame if it has sufficient state to do so.

To support this process, the server sends a stateless_reset_token value during
the handshake in the transport parameters.  This value is protected by
encryption, so only client and server know this value.

A server that receives packets that it cannot process sends a packet in the
following layout:

~~~
 0                   1                   2                   3

|                                                               |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
~~~

This design ensures that a stateless reset packet is - to the extent possible -
indistinguishable from a regular packet.

A server generates a random 18-octet Destination Connection ID field.  For a
client that depends on the server including a connection ID, this will mean that
this value differs from previous packets.  Ths results in two problems:

* The packet might not reach the client.  If the Destination Connection ID is
  critical for routing toward the client, then this packet could be incorrectly
  routed.  This causes the stateless reset to be ineffective in causing errors
  to be quickly detected and recovered.  In this case, clients will need to rely
  on other methods - such as timers - to detect that the connection has failed.

* The randomly generated connection ID can be used by entities other than the
  client to identify this as a potential stateless reset.  A server that
  occasionally uses different connection IDs might introduce some uncertainty
  about this.

The Packet Number field is set to a randomized value.  The server SHOULD send a
packet with a short header and a type of 0x1F.  This produces the shortest
possible packet number encoding, which minimizes the perceived gap between the
last packet that the server sent and this packet.  A server MAY use a different
short header type, indicating a different packet number length, but a longer
packet number encoding might allow this message to be identified as a stateless
reset more easily using heuristics.

After the Packet Number, the server pads the message with an arbitrary
number of octets containing random values.

Finally, the last 16 octets of the packet are set to the value of the Stateless
Reset Token.

A stateless reset is not appropriate for signaling error conditions.  An
endpoint that wishes to communicate a fatal connection error MUST use a
CONNECTION_CLOSE or APPLICATION_CLOSE frame if it has sufficient state to do so.

This stateless reset design is specific to QUIC version 1.  A server that
supports multiple versions of QUIC needs to generate a stateless reset that will
be accepted by clients that support any version that the server might support
(or might have supported prior to losing state).  Designers of new versions of
QUIC need to be aware of this and either reuse this design, or use a portion of
the packet other than the last 16 octets for carrying data.


#### Detecting a Stateless Reset

A client detects a potential stateless reset when a packet with a short header
either cannot be decrypted or is marked as a duplicate packet.  The client then
compares the last 16 octets of the packet with the Stateless Reset Token
provided by the server in its transport parameters.  If these values are
identical, the client MUST enter the draining period and not send any further
packets on this connection.  If the comparison fails, the packet can be
discarded.


#### Calculating a Stateless Reset Token

The stateless reset token MUST be difficult to guess.  In order to create a
Stateless Reset Token, a server could randomly generate {{!RFC4086}} a secret
for every connection that it creates.  However, this presents a coordination
problem when there are multiple servers in a cluster or a storage problem for a
server that might lose state.  Stateless reset specifically exists to handle the
case where state is lost, so this approach is suboptimal.

A single static key can be used across all connections to the same endpoint by
generating the proof using a second iteration of a preimage-resistant function
that takes three inputs: the static key, the server's connection ID (see
{{connection-id}}), and an identifier for the server instance.  A server could
use HMAC {{?RFC2104}} (for example, HMAC(static_key, server_id ||
connection_id)) or HKDF {{?RFC5869}} (for example, using the static key as input
keying material, with server and connection identifiers as salt).  The output of
this function is truncated to 16 octets to produce the Stateless Reset Token for
that connection.

A server that loses state can use the same method to generate a valid Stateless
Reset Secret.  The connection ID comes from the packet that the server receives.

This design relies on the client always sending a connection ID in its packets
so that the server can use the connection ID from a packet to reset the
connection.  A server that uses this design cannot allow clients to use a
zero-length connection ID.

Revealing the Stateless Reset Token allows any entity to terminate the
connection, so a value can only be used once.  This method for choosing the
Stateless Reset Token means that the combination of server instance, connection
ID, and static key cannot occur for another connection.  A connection ID from a
connection that is reset by revealing the Stateless Reset Token cannot be
reused for new connections at the same server without first changing to use a
different static key or server identifier.

Note that Stateless Reset messages do not have any cryptographic protection.


# Frame Types and Formats

As described in {{frames}}, packets contain one or more frames. This section
describes the format and semantics of the core QUIC frame types.


## Variable-Length Integer Encoding {#integer-encoding}

QUIC frames use a common variable-length encoding for all non-negative integer
values.  This encoding ensures that smaller integer values need fewer octets to
encode.

The QUIC variable-length integer encoding reserves the two most significant bits
of the first octet to encode the base 2 logarithm of the integer encoding length
in octets.  The integer value is encoded on the remaining bits, in network byte
order.

This means that integers are encoded on 1, 2, 4, or 8 octets and can encode 6,
14, 30, or 62 bit values respectively.  {{integer-summary}} summarizes the
encoding properties.

| 2Bit | Length | Usable Bits | Range                 |
|:-----|:-------|:------------|:----------------------|
| 00   | 1      | 6           | 0-63                  |
| 01   | 2      | 14          | 0-16383               |
| 10   | 4      | 30          | 0-1073741823          |
| 11   | 8      | 62          | 0-4611686018427387903 |
{: #integer-summary title="Summary of Integer Encodings"}

For example, the eight octet sequence c2 19 7c 5e ff 14 e8 8c (in hexadecimal)
decodes to the decimal value 151288809941952652; the four octet sequence 9d 7f
3e 7d decodes to 494878333; the two octet sequence 7b bd decodes to 15293; and
the single octet 25 decodes to 37 (as does the two octet sequence 40 25).

Error codes ({{error-codes}}) are described using integers, but do not use this
encoding.


## PADDING Frame {#frame-padding}

The PADDING frame (type=0x00) has no semantic value.  PADDING frames can be used
to increase the size of a packet.  Padding can be used to increase an initial
client packet to the minimum required size, or to provide protection against
traffic analysis for protected packets.

A PADDING frame has no content.  That is, a PADDING frame consists of the single
octet that identifies the frame as a PADDING frame.


## RST_STREAM Frame {#frame-rst-stream}

An endpoint may use a RST_STREAM frame (type=0x01) to abruptly terminate a
stream.

After sending a RST_STREAM, an endpoint ceases transmission and retransmission
of STREAM frames on the identified stream.  A receiver of RST_STREAM can discard
any data that it already received on that stream.

An endpoint that receives a RST_STREAM frame for a send-only stream MUST
terminate the connection with error PROTOCOL_VIOLATION.

The RST_STREAM frame is as follows:

~~~
 0                   1                   2                   3
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|                        Stream ID (i)                        ...
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|  Application Error Code (16)  |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|                       Final Offset (i)                     ...
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
~~~

The fields are:

Stream ID:

: A variable-length integer encoding of the Stream ID of the stream being
  terminated.

Application Protocol Error Code:

: A 16-bit application protocol error code (see {{app-error-codes}}) which
  indicates why the stream is being closed.

Final Offset:

: A variable-length integer indicating the absolute byte offset of the end of
  data written on this stream by the RST_STREAM sender.


## CONNECTION_CLOSE frame {#frame-connection-close}

An endpoint sends a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame (type=0x02) to notify its peer that
the connection is being closed.  CONNECTION_CLOSE is used to signal errors at
the QUIC layer, or the absence of errors (with the NO_ERROR code).

If there are open streams that haven't been explicitly closed, they are
implicitly closed when the connection is closed.

The CONNECTION_CLOSE frame is as follows:

~~~
 0                   1                   2                   3
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|           Error Code (16)     |   Reason Phrase Length (i)  ...
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|                        Reason Phrase (*)                    ...
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
~~~

The fields of a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame are as follows:

Error Code:

: A 16-bit error code which indicates the reason for closing this connection.
  CONNECTION_CLOSE uses codes from the space defined in {{error-codes}}
  (APPLICATION_CLOSE uses codes from the application protocol error code space,
  see {{app-error-codes}}).

Reason Phrase Length:

: A variable-length integer specifying the length of the reason phrase in bytes.
  Note that a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame cannot be split between packets, so in
  practice any limits on packet size will also limit the space available for a
  reason phrase.

Reason Phrase:

: A human-readable explanation for why the connection was closed.  This can be
  zero length if the sender chooses to not give details beyond the Error Code.
  This SHOULD be a UTF-8 encoded string {{!RFC3629}}.


## APPLICATION_CLOSE frame {#frame-application-close}

An APPLICATION_CLOSE frame (type=0x03) uses the same format as the
CONNECTION_CLOSE frame ({{frame-connection-close}}), except that it uses error
codes from the application protocol error code space ({{app-error-codes}})
instead of the transport error code space.

Other than the error code space, the format and semantics of the
APPLICATION_CLOSE frame are identical to the CONNECTION_CLOSE frame.


## MAX_DATA Frame {#frame-max-data}

The MAX_DATA frame (type=0x04) is used in flow control to inform the peer of
the maximum amount of data that can be sent on the connection as a whole.

The frame is as follows:

~~~
 0                   1                   2                   3
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|                        Maximum Data (i)                     ...
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
~~~

The fields in the MAX_DATA frame are as follows:

Maximum Data:

: A variable-length integer indicating the maximum amount of data that can be
  sent on the entire connection, in units of octets.

All data sent in STREAM frames counts toward this limit, with the exception of
data on stream 0.  The sum of the largest received offsets on all streams -
including streams in terminal states, but excluding stream 0 - MUST NOT exceed
the value advertised by a receiver.  An endpoint MUST terminate a connection
with a QUIC_FLOW_CONTROL_RECEIVED_TOO_MUCH_DATA error if it receives more data
than the maximum data value that it has sent, unless this is a result of a
change in the initial limits (see {{zerortt-parameters}}).


## MAX_STREAM_DATA Frame {#frame-max-stream-data}

The MAX_STREAM_DATA frame (type=0x05) is used in flow control to inform a peer
of the maximum amount of data that can be sent on a stream.

An endpoint that receives a MAX_STREAM_DATA frame for a receive-only stream
MUST terminate the connection with error PROTOCOL_VIOLATION.

An endpoint that receives a MAX_STREAM_DATA frame for a send-only stream
it has not opened MUST terminate the connection with error PROTOCOL_VIOLATION.

Note that an endpoint may legally receive a MAX_STREAM_DATA frame on a
bidirectional stream it has not opened.

The frame is as follows:

~~~
 0                   1                   2                   3
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|                        Stream ID (i)                        ...
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|                    Maximum Stream Data (i)                  ...
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
~~~

The fields in the MAX_STREAM_DATA frame are as follows:

Stream ID:

: The stream ID of the stream that is affected encoded as a variable-length
  integer.

Maximum Stream Data:

: A variable-length integer indicating the maximum amount of data that can be
  sent on the identified stream, in units of octets.

When counting data toward this limit, an endpoint accounts for the largest
received offset of data that is sent or received on the stream.  Loss or
reordering can mean that the largest received offset on a stream can be greater
than the total size of data received on that stream.  Receiving STREAM frames
might not increase the largest received offset.

The data sent on a stream MUST NOT exceed the largest maximum stream data value
advertised by the receiver.  An endpoint MUST terminate a connection with a
FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR error if it receives more data than the largest maximum
stream data that it has sent for the affected stream, unless this is a result of
a change in the initial limits (see {{zerortt-parameters}}).


## MAX_STREAM_ID Frame {#frame-max-stream-id}

The MAX_STREAM_ID frame (type=0x06) informs the peer of the maximum stream ID
that they are permitted to open.

The frame is as follows:

~~~
 0                   1                   2                   3
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|                    Maximum Stream ID (i)                    ...
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
~~~

The fields in the MAX_STREAM_ID frame are as follows:

Maximum Stream ID:
: ID of the maximum unidirectional or bidirectional peer-initiated stream ID for
  the connection encoded as a variable-length integer. The limit applies to
  unidirectional steams if the second least signification bit of the stream ID
  is 1, and applies to bidirectional streams if it is 0.

Loss or reordering can mean that a MAX_STREAM_ID frame can be received which
states a lower stream limit than the client has previously received.
MAX_STREAM_ID frames which do not increase the maximum stream ID MUST be
ignored.

A peer MUST NOT initiate a stream with a higher stream ID than the greatest
maximum stream ID it has received.  An endpoint MUST terminate a connection with
a STREAM_ID_ERROR error if a peer initiates a stream with a higher stream ID
than it has sent, unless this is a result of a change in the initial limits (see
{{zerortt-parameters}}).


## PING Frame {#frame-ping}

Endpoints can use PING frames (type=0x07) to verify that their peers are still
alive or to check reachability to the peer. The PING frame contains no
additional fields.

The receiver of a PING frame simply needs to acknowledge the packet containing
this frame.

The PING frame can be used to keep a connection alive when an application or
application protocol wishes to prevent the connection from timing out. An
application protocol SHOULD provide guidance about the conditions under which
generating a PING is recommended.  This guidance SHOULD indicate whether it is
the client or the server that is expected to send the PING.  Having both
endpoints send PING frames without coordination can produce an excessive number
of packets and poor performance.

A connection will time out if no packets are sent or received for a period
longer than the time specified in the idle_timeout transport parameter (see
{{termination}}).  However, state in middleboxes might time out earlier than
that.  Though REQ-5 in {{?RFC4787}} recommends a 2 minute timeout interval,
experience shows that sending packets every 15 to 30 seconds is necessary to
prevent the majority of middleboxes from losing state for UDP flows.


## BLOCKED Frame {#frame-blocked}

A sender SHOULD send a BLOCKED frame (type=0x08) when it wishes to send data,
but is unable to due to connection-level flow control (see {{blocking}}).
BLOCKED frames can be used as input to tuning of flow control algorithms (see
{{fc-credit}}).

The BLOCKED frame is as follows:

~~~
 0                   1                   2                   3
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|                         Offset (i)                         ...
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
~~~

The BLOCKED frame contains a single field.

Offset:

: A variable-length integer indicating the connection-level offset at which
  the blocking occurred.


## STREAM_BLOCKED Frame {#frame-stream-blocked}

A sender SHOULD send a STREAM_BLOCKED frame (type=0x09) when it wishes to send
data, but is unable to due to stream-level flow control.  This frame is
analogous to BLOCKED ({{frame-blocked}}).

An endpoint that receives a STREAM_BLOCKED frame for a send-only stream MUST
terminate the connection with error PROTOCOL_VIOLATION.

The STREAM_BLOCKED frame is as follows:

~~~
 0                   1                   2                   3
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|                        Stream ID (i)                        ...
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|                         Offset (i)                          ...
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
~~~

The STREAM_BLOCKED frame contains two fields:

Stream ID:

: A variable-length integer indicating the stream which is flow control blocked.

Offset:

: A variable-length integer indicating the offset of the stream at which the
  blocking occurred.


## STREAM_ID_BLOCKED Frame {#frame-stream-id-blocked}

A sender MAY send a STREAM_ID_BLOCKED frame (type=0x0a) when it wishes to open a
stream, but is unable to due to the maximum stream ID limit set by its peer (see
{{frame-max-stream-id}}).  This does not open the stream, but informs the peer
that a new stream was needed, but the stream limit prevented the creation of the
stream.

The STREAM_ID_BLOCKED frame is as follows:

~~~
 0                   1                   2                   3
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|                        Stream ID (i)                        ...
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
~~~

The STREAM_ID_BLOCKED frame contains a single field.

Stream ID:

: A variable-length integer indicating the highest stream ID that the sender
  was permitted to open.

## NEW_CONNECTION_ID Frame {#frame-new-connection-id}

An endpoint sends a NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame (type=0x0b) to provide its peer with
alternative connection IDs that can be used to break linkability when migrating
connections (see {{migration-linkability}}).

The NEW_CONNECTION_ID is as follows:

~~~
 0                   1                   2                   3
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|                          Sequence (i)                       ...
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|   Length (8)  |          Connection ID (32..144)            ...
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|                                                               |
+                                                               +
|                                                               |
+                   Stateless Reset Token (128)                 +
|                                                               |
+                                                               +
|                                                               |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
~~~

The fields are:

Sequence:

: A variable-length integer.  This value starts at 0 and increases by 1 for each
  connection ID that is provided by the server.  The connection ID that is
  assigned during the handshake is assumed to have a sequence of -1.  That is,
  the value selected during the handshake comes immediately before the first
  value that a server can send.

Length:

: An 8-bit unsigned integer containing the length of the connection ID.  Values
  less than 4 and greater than 18 are invalid and MUST be treated as a
  connection error of type PROTOCOL_VIOLATION.

Connection ID:

: A connection ID of the specified length.

Stateless Reset Token:

: A 128-bit value that will be used to for a stateless reset when the associated
  connection ID is used (see {{stateless-reset}}).

An endpoint MUST NOT send this frame if it currently requires that its peer send
packets with a zero-length Destination Connection ID.  Changing the length of a
connection ID to or from zero-length makes it difficult to identify when the
value of the connection ID changed.  An endpoint that is sending packets with a
zero-length Destination Connection ID MUST treat receipt of a NEW_CONNECTION_ID
frame as a connection error of type PROTOCOL_VIOLATION.


## STOP_SENDING Frame {#frame-stop-sending}

An endpoint may use a STOP_SENDING frame (type=0x0c) to communicate that
incoming data is being discarded on receipt at application request.  This
signals a peer to abruptly terminate transmission on a stream.

An endpoint that receives a STOP_SENDING frame for a receive-only stream MUST
terminate the connection with error PROTOCOL_VIOLATION.

The STOP_SENDING frame is as follows:

~~~
 0                   1                   2                   3
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|                        Stream ID (i)                        ...
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|  Application Error Code (16)  |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
~~~

The fields are:

Stream ID:

: A variable-length integer carrying the Stream ID of the stream being ignored.

Application Error Code:

: A 16-bit, application-specified reason the sender is ignoring the stream (see
  {{app-error-codes}}).


## ACK Frame {#frame-ack}

Receivers send ACK frames (type=0x0d) to inform senders which packets they have
received and processed.  A sent packet that has never been acknowledged is
missing. The ACK frame contains any number of ACK blocks.  ACK blocks are
ranges of acknowledged packets.

Unlike TCP SACKs, QUIC acknowledgements are irrevocable.  Once a packet has
been acknowledged, even if it does not appear in a future ACK frame,
it remains acknowledged.

A client MUST NOT acknowledge Retry packets.  Retry packets include the packet
number from the Initial packet it responds to.  Version Negotiation packets
cannot be acknowledged because they do not contain a packet number.  Rather than
relying on ACK frames, these packets are implicitly acknowledged by the next
Initial packet sent by the client.

A sender MAY intentionally skip packet numbers to introduce entropy into the
connection, to avoid opportunistic acknowledgement attacks.  The sender SHOULD
close the connection if an unsent packet number is acknowledged.  The format of
the ACK frame is efficient at expressing even long blocks of missing packets,
allowing for large, unpredictable gaps.

An ACK frame is shown below.

~~~
 0                   1                   2                   3

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
~~~
{: #ack-format title="ACK Frame Format"}

The fields in the ACK frame are as follows:

Largest Acknowledged:

: A variable-length integer representing the largest packet number the peer is
  acknowledging; this is usually the largest packet number that the peer has
  received prior to generating the ACK frame.  Unlike the packet number in the
  QUIC long or short header, the value in an ACK frame is not truncated.

ACK Delay:

: A variable-length integer including the time in microseconds that the largest
  acknowledged packet, as indicated in the Largest Acknowledged field, was
  received by this peer to when this ACK was sent.  The value of the ACK Delay
  field is scaled by multiplying the encoded value by the 2 to the power of the
  value of the `ack_delay_exponent` transport parameter set by the sender of the
  ACK frame.  The `ack_delay_exponent` defaults to 3, or a multiplier of 8 (see
  {{transport-parameter-definitions}}).  Scaling in this fashion allows for a
  larger range of values with a shorter encoding at the cost of lower
  resolution.

ACK Block Count:

: The number of Additional ACK Block (and Gap) fields after the First ACK Block.

ACK Blocks:

: Contains one or more blocks of packet numbers which have been successfully
  received, see {{ack-block-section}}.


### ACK Block Section {#ack-block-section}

The ACK Block Section consists of alternating Gap and ACK Block fields in
descending packet number order.  A First Ack Block field is followed by a
variable number of alternating Gap and Additional ACK Blocks.  The number of Gap
and Additional ACK Block fields is determined by the ACK Block Count field.

Gap and ACK Block fields use a relative integer encoding for efficiency.  Though
each encoded value is positive, the values are subtracted, so that each ACK
Block describes progressively lower-numbered packets.  As long as contiguous
ranges of packets are small, the variable-length integer encoding ensures that
each range can be expressed in a small number of octets.

{: #ack-block-format title="ACK Block Section"}

Each ACK Block acknowledges a contiguous range of packets by indicating the
number of acknowledged packets that precede the largest packet number in that
block.  A value of zero indicates that only the largest packet number is
acknowledged.  Larger ACK Block values indicate a larger range, with
corresponding lower values for the smallest packet number in the range.  Thus,
given a largest packet number for the ACK, the smallest value is determined by
the formula:

~~~
   smallest = largest - ack_block
~~~

The range of packets that are acknowledged by the ACK block include the range
from the smallest packet number to the largest, inclusive.

The largest value for the First ACK Block is determined by the Largest
Acknowledged field; the largest for Additional ACK Blocks is determined by
cumulatively subtracting the size of all preceding ACK Blocks and Gaps.

Each Gap indicates a range of packets that are not being acknowledged.  The
number of packets in the gap is one higher than the encoded value of the Gap
Field.

The value of the Gap field establishes the largest packet number value for the
ACK block that follows the gap using the following formula:

~~~
  largest = previous_smallest - gap - 2
~~~

If the calculated value for largest or smallest packet number for any ACK Block
is negative, an endpoint MUST generate a connection error of type FRAME_ERROR
indicating an error in an ACK frame (that is, 0x10d).

The fields in the ACK Block Section are:

First ACK Block:

: A variable-length integer indicating the number of contiguous packets
  preceding the Largest Acknowledged that are being acknowledged.

Gap (repeated):

: A variable-length integer indicating the number of contiguous unacknowledged
  packets preceding the packet number one lower than the smallest in the
  preceding ACK Block.

ACK Block (repeated):

: A variable-length integer indicating the number of contiguous acknowledged
  packets preceding the largest packet number, as determined by the
  preceding Gap.

### Sending ACK Frames

Implementations MUST NOT generate packets that only contain ACK frames in
response to packets which only contain ACK frames. However, they MUST
acknowledge packets containing only ACK frames when sending ACK frames in
response to other packets.  Implementations MUST NOT send more than one ACK
frame per received packet that contains frames other than ACK frames.  Packets
containing non-ACK frames MUST be acknowledged immediately or when a delayed
ack timer expires.

To limit ACK blocks to those that have not yet been received by the sender, the
receiver SHOULD track which ACK frames have been acknowledged by its peer.  Once
an ACK frame has been acknowledged, the packets it acknowledges SHOULD NOT be
acknowledged again.

A receiver that is only sending ACK frames will not receive acknowledgments for
its packets.  Sending an occasional MAX_DATA or MAX_STREAM_DATA frame as data is
received will ensure that acknowledgements are generated by a peer.  Otherwise,
an endpoint MAY send a PING frame once per RTT to solicit an acknowledgment.

To limit receiver state or the size of ACK frames, a receiver MAY limit the
number of ACK blocks it sends.  A receiver can do this even without receiving
acknowledgment of its ACK frames, with the knowledge this could cause the sender
to unnecessarily retransmit some data.  Standard QUIC {{QUIC-RECOVERY}}
algorithms declare packets lost after sufficiently newer packets are
acknowledged.  Therefore, the receiver SHOULD repeatedly acknowledge newly
received packets in preference to packets received in the past.

### ACK Frames and Packet Protection

ACK frames that acknowledge protected packets MUST be carried in a packet that
has an equivalent or greater level of packet protection.

Packets that are protected with 1-RTT keys MUST be acknowledged in packets that
are also protected with 1-RTT keys.

A packet that is not protected and claims to acknowledge a packet number that
was sent with packet protection is not valid.  An unprotected packet that
carries acknowledgments for protected packets MUST be discarded in its entirety.

Packets that a client sends with 0-RTT packet protection MUST be acknowledged by
the server in packets protected by 1-RTT keys.  This can mean that the client is
unable to use these acknowledgments if the server cryptographic handshake
messages are delayed or lost.  Note that the same limitation applies to other
data sent by the server protected by the 1-RTT keys.

Unprotected packets, such as those that carry the initial cryptographic
handshake messages, MAY be acknowledged in unprotected packets.  Unprotected
packets are vulnerable to falsification or modification.  Unprotected packets
can be acknowledged along with protected packets in a protected packet.

An endpoint SHOULD acknowledge packets containing cryptographic handshake
messages in the next unprotected packet that it sends, unless it is able to
acknowledge those packets in later packets protected by 1-RTT keys.  At the
completion of the cryptographic handshake, both peers send unprotected packets
containing cryptographic handshake messages followed by packets protected by
1-RTT keys. An endpoint SHOULD acknowledge the unprotected packets that complete
the cryptographic handshake in a protected packet, because its peer is
guaranteed to have access to 1-RTT packet protection keys.

For instance, a server acknowledges a TLS ClientHello in the packet that carries
the TLS ServerHello; similarly, a client can acknowledge a TLS HelloRetryRequest
in the packet containing a second TLS ClientHello.  The complete set of server
handshake messages (TLS ServerHello through to Finished) might be acknowledged
by a client in protected packets, because it is certain that the server is able
to decipher the packet.


## PATH_CHALLENGE Frame {#frame-path-challenge}

Endpoints can use PATH_CHALLENGE frames (type=0x0e) to check reachability to the
peer and for address validation during connection establishment and connection
migration.

PATH_CHALLENGE frames contain an 8-byte payload.

Data:

: This 8-byte field contains arbitrary data.

A PATH_CHALLENGE frame containing 8 octets that are hard to guess is sufficient
to ensure that it is easier to receive the packet than it is to guess the value
correctly.

The recipient of this frame MUST generate a PATH_RESPONSE frame
({{frame-path-response}}) containing the same Data.


## PATH_RESPONSE Frame {#frame-path-response}

The PATH_RESPONSE frame (type=0x0f) is sent in response to a PATH_CHALLENGE
frame.  Its format is identical to the PATH_CHALLENGE frame
({{frame-path-challenge}}).

If the content of a PATH_RESPONSE frame does not match the content of a
PATH_CHALLENGE frame previously sent by the endpoint, the endpoint MAY generate
a connection error of type UNSOLICITED_PATH_RESPONSE.


## STREAM Frames {#frame-stream}

STREAM frames implicitly create a stream and carry stream data.  The STREAM
frame takes the form 0b00010XXX (or the set of values from 0x10 to 0x17).  The
value of the three low-order bits of the frame type determine the fields that
are present in the frame.

* The OFF bit (0x04) in the frame type is set to indicate that there is an
  Offset field present.  When set to 1, the Offset field is present; when set to
  0, the Offset field is absent and the Stream Data starts at an offset of 0
  (that is, the frame contains the first octets of the stream, or the end of a
  stream that includes no data).

* The LEN bit (0x02) in the frame type is set to indicate that there is a Length
  field present.  If this bit is set to 0, the Length field is absent and the
  Stream Data field extends to the end of the packet.  If this bit is set to 1,
  the Length field is present.

* The FIN bit (0x01) of the frame type is set only on frames that contain the
  final offset of the stream.  Setting this bit indicates that the frame
  marks the end of the stream.

An endpoint that receives a STREAM frame for a send-only stream MUST terminate
the connection with error PROTOCOL_VIOLATION.

A STREAM frame is shown below.

~~~
{: #stream-format title="STREAM Frame Format"}

The STREAM frame contains the following fields:

Stream ID:

: A variable-length integer indicating the stream ID of the stream (see
  {{stream-id}}).

Offset:

: A variable-length integer specifying the byte offset in the stream for the
  data in this STREAM frame.  This field is present when the OFF bit is set to
  1.  When the Offset field is absent, the offset is 0.

Length:

: A variable-length integer specifying the length of the Stream Data field in
  this STREAM frame.  This field is present when the LEN bit is set to 1.  When
  the LEN bit is set to 0, the Stream Data field consumes all the remaining
  octets in the packet.

Stream Data:

: The bytes from the designated stream to be delivered.

A stream frame's Stream Data MUST NOT be empty, unless the FIN bit is set.  When
the FIN flag is sent on an empty STREAM frame, the offset in the STREAM frame is
the offset of the next byte that would be sent.

The first byte in the stream has an offset of 0.  The largest offset delivered
on a stream - the sum of the re-constructed offset and data length - MUST be
less than 2^62.

Stream multiplexing is achieved by interleaving STREAM frames from multiple
streams into one or more QUIC packets.  A single QUIC packet can include
multiple STREAM frames from one or more streams.

Implementation note: One of the benefits of QUIC is avoidance of head-of-line
blocking across multiple streams.  When a packet loss occurs, only streams with
data in that packet are blocked waiting for a retransmission to be received,
while other streams can continue making progress.  Note that when data from
multiple streams is bundled into a single QUIC packet, loss of that packet
blocks all those streams from making progress.  An implementation is therefore
advised to bundle as few streams as necessary in outgoing packets without losing
transmission efficiency to underfilled packets.


# Packetization and Reliability {#packetization}

A sender bundles one or more frames in a QUIC packet (see {{frames}}).

A sender SHOULD minimize per-packet bandwidth and computational costs by
bundling as many frames as possible within a QUIC packet.  A sender MAY wait for
a short period of time to bundle multiple frames before sending a packet that is
not maximally packed, to avoid sending out large numbers of small packets.  An
implementation may use knowledge about application sending behavior or
heuristics to determine whether and for how long to wait.  This waiting period
is an implementation decision, and an implementation should be careful to delay
conservatively, since any delay is likely to increase application-visible
latency.


## Packet Processing and Acknowledgment

A packet MUST NOT be acknowledged until packet protection has been successfully
removed and all frames contained in the packet have been processed.  Any stream
state transitions triggered by the frame MUST have occurred.  For STREAM frames,
this means the data has been enqueued in preparation to be received by the
application protocol, but it does not require that data is delivered and
consumed.

Once the packet has been fully processed, a receiver acknowledges receipt by
sending one or more ACK frames containing the packet number of the received
packet.  To avoid creating an indefinite feedback loop, an endpoint MUST NOT
send an ACK frame in response to a packet containing only ACK or PADDING frames,
even if there are packet gaps which precede the received packet.  The endpoint
MUST acknowledge packets containing only ACK or PADDING frames in the next ACK
frame that it sends.

Strategies and implications of the frequency of generating acknowledgments are
discussed in more detail in {{QUIC-RECOVERY}}.


## Retransmission of Information

QUIC packets that are determined to be lost are not retransmitted whole. The
same applies to the frames that are contained within lost packets. Instead, the
information that might be carried in frames is sent again in new frames as
needed.

New frames and packets are used to carry information that is determined to have
been lost.  In general, information is sent again when a packet containing that
information is determined to be lost and sending ceases when a packet
containing that information is acknowledged.

* Application data sent in STREAM frames is retransmitted in new STREAM frames
  unless the endpoint has sent a RST_STREAM for that stream.  Once an endpoint
  sends a RST_STREAM frame, no further STREAM frames are needed.

* The most recent set of acknowledgments are sent in ACK frames.  An ACK frame
  SHOULD contain all unacknowledged acknowledgments, as described in
  {{sending-ack-frames}}.

* Cancellation of stream transmission, as carried in a RST_STREAM frame, is
  sent until acknowledged or until all stream data is acknowledged by the peer
  (that is, either the "Reset Recvd" or "Data Recvd" state is reached on the
  send stream). The content of a RST_STREAM frame MUST NOT change when it is
  sent again.

* Similarly, a request to cancel stream transmission, as encoded in a
  STOP_SENDING frame, is sent until the receive stream enters either a "Data
  Recvd" or "Reset Recvd" state, see {{solicited-state-transitions}}.

* Connection close signals, including those that use CONNECTION_CLOSE and
  APPLICATION_CLOSE frames, are not sent again when packet loss is detected, but
  as described in {{termination}}.

* The current connection maximum data is sent in MAX_DATA frames. An updated
  value is sent in a MAX_DATA frame if the packet containing the most recently
  sent MAX_DATA frame is declared lost, or when the endpoint decides to update
  the limit.  Care is necessary to avoid sending this frame too often as the
  limit can increase frequently and cause an unnecessarily large number of
  MAX_DATA frames to be sent.

* The current maximum stream data offset is sent in MAX_STREAM_DATA frames.
  Like MAX_DATA, an updated value is sent when the packet containing
  the most recent MAX_STREAM_DATA frame for a stream is lost or when the limit
  is updated, with care taken to prevent the frame from being sent too often. An
  endpoint SHOULD stop sending MAX_STREAM_DATA frames when the receive stream
  enters a "Size Known" state.

* The maximum stream ID for a stream of a given type is sent in MAX_STREAM_ID
  frames.  Like MAX_DATA, an updated value is sent when a packet containing the
  most recent MAX_STREAM_ID for a stream type frame is declared lost or when
  the limit is updated, with care taken to prevent the frame from being sent
  too often.

* Blocked signals are carried in BLOCKED, STREAM_BLOCKED, and STREAM_ID_BLOCKED
  frames. BLOCKED streams have connection scope, STREAM_BLOCKED frames have
  stream scope, and STREAM_ID_BLOCKED frames are scoped to a specific stream
  type. New frames are sent if packets containing the most recent frame for a
  scope is lost, but only while the endpoint is blocked on the corresponding
  limit. These frames always include the limit that is causing blocking at the
  time that they are transmitted.

* A liveness or path validation check using PATH_CHALLENGE frames is sent
  periodically until a matching PATH_RESPONSE frame is received or until there
  is no remaining need for liveness or path validation checking. PATH_CHALLENGE
  frames include a different payload each time they are sent.

* Responses to path validation using PATH_RESPONSE frames are sent just once.
  A new PATH_CHALLENGE frame will be sent if another PATH_RESPONSE frame is
  needed.

* New connection IDs are sent in NEW_CONNECTION_ID frames and retransmitted if
  the packet containing them is lost.

* PADDING frames contain no information, so lost PADDING frames do not require
  repair.

Upon detecting losses, a sender MUST take appropriate congestion control action.
The details of loss detection and congestion control are described in
{{QUIC-RECOVERY}}.


## Packet Size {#packet-size}

The QUIC packet size includes the QUIC header and integrity check, but not the
UDP or IP header.

Clients MUST pad any Initial packet it sends to have a QUIC packet size of at
least 1200 octets. Sending an Initial packet of this size ensures that the
network path supports a reasonably sized packet, and helps reduce the amplitude
of amplification attacks caused by server responses toward an unverified client
address.

An Initial packet MAY exceed 1200 octets if the client knows that the Path
Maximum Transmission Unit (PMTU) supports the size that it chooses.

A server MAY send a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame with error code PROTOCOL_VIOLATION in
response to an Initial packet smaller than 1200 octets. It MUST NOT send any
other frame type in response, or otherwise behave as if any part of the
offending packet was processed as valid.

## Path Maximum Transmission Unit

The Path Maximum Transmission Unit (PMTU) is the maximum size of the entire IP
header, UDP header, and UDP payload. The UDP payload includes the QUIC packet
header, protected payload, and any authentication fields.

All QUIC packets SHOULD be sized to fit within the estimated PMTU to avoid IP
fragmentation or packet drops. To optimize bandwidth efficiency, endpoints
SHOULD use Packetization Layer PMTU Discovery ({{!PLPMTUD=RFC4821}}).  Endpoints
MAY use PMTU Discovery ({{!PMTUDv4=RFC1191}}, {{!PMTUDv6=RFC8201}}) for
detecting the PMTU, setting the PMTU appropriately, and storing the result of
previous PMTU determinations.

In the absence of these mechanisms, QUIC endpoints SHOULD NOT send IP packets
larger than 1280 octets. Assuming the minimum IP header size, this results in
a QUIC packet size of 1232 octets for IPv6 and 1252 octets for IPv4. Some
QUIC implementations MAY wish to be more conservative in computing allowed
QUIC packet size given unknown tunneling overheads or IP header options.

QUIC endpoints that implement any kind of PMTU discovery SHOULD maintain an
estimate for each combination of local and remote IP addresses.  Each pairing of
local and remote addresses could have a different maximum MTU in the path.

QUIC depends on the network path supporting a MTU of at least 1280 octets. This
is the IPv6 minimum MTU and therefore also supported by most modern IPv4
networks.  An endpoint MUST NOT reduce its MTU below this number, even if it
receives signals that indicate a smaller limit might exist.

If a QUIC endpoint determines that the PMTU between any pair of local and remote
IP addresses has fallen below 1280 octets, it MUST immediately cease sending
QUIC packets on the affected path.  This could result in termination of the
connection if an alternative path cannot be found.


### Special Considerations for PMTU Discovery

Traditional ICMP-based path MTU discovery in IPv4 {{!RFC1191}} is potentially
vulnerable to off-path attacks that successfully guess the IP/port 4-tuple and
reduce the MTU to a bandwidth-inefficient value. TCP connections mitigate this
risk by using the (at minimum) 8 bytes of transport header echoed in the ICMP
message to validate the TCP sequence number as valid for the current
connection. However, as QUIC operates over UDP, in IPv4 the echoed information
could consist only of the IP and UDP headers, which usually has insufficient
entropy to mitigate off-path attacks.

As a result, endpoints that implement PMTUD in IPv4 SHOULD take steps to
mitigate this risk. For instance, an application could:

* Set the IPv4 Don't Fragment (DF) bit on a small proportion of packets, so that
most invalid ICMP messages arrive when there are no DF packets outstanding, and
can therefore be identified as spurious.

* Store additional information from the IP or UDP headers from DF packets (for
example, the IP ID or UDP checksum) to further authenticate incoming Datagram
Too Big messages.

* Any reduction in PMTU due to a report contained in an ICMP packet is
provisional until QUIC's loss detection algorithm determines that the packet is
actually lost.


### Special Considerations for Packetization Layer PMTU Discovery


The PADDING frame provides a useful option for PMTU probe packets that does not
exist in other transports. PADDING frames generate acknowledgements, but their
content need not be delivered reliably. PADDING frames may delay the delivery of
application data, as they consume the congestion window. However, by definition
their likely loss in a probe packet does not require delay-inducing
retransmission of application data.

When implementing the algorithm in Section 7.2 of {{!RFC4821}}, the initial
value of search_low SHOULD be consistent with the IPv6 minimum packet size.
Paths that do not support this size cannot deliver Initial packets, and
therefore are not QUIC-compliant.

Section 7.3 of {{!RFC4821}} discusses tradeoffs between small and large
increases in the size of probe packets. As QUIC probe packets need not contain
application data, aggressive increases in probe size carry fewer consequences.


# Streams: QUIC's Data Structuring Abstraction {#streams}

Streams in QUIC provide a lightweight, ordered byte-stream abstraction.

There are two basic types of stream in QUIC.  Unidirectional streams carry data
in one direction only; bidirectional streams allow for data to be sent in both
directions.  Different stream identifiers are used to distinguish between
unidirectional and bidirectional streams, as well as to create a separation
between streams that are initiated by the client and server (see {{stream-id}}).

Either type of stream can be created by either endpoint, can concurrently send
data interleaved with other streams, and can be cancelled.

Stream offsets allow for the octets on a stream to be placed in order.  An
endpoint MUST be capable of delivering data received on a stream in order.
Implementations MAY choose to offer the ability to deliver data out of order.
There is no means of ensuring ordering between octets on different streams.

The creation and destruction of streams are expected to have minimal bandwidth
and computational cost.  A single STREAM frame may create, carry data for, and
terminate a stream, or a stream may last the entire duration of a connection.

Streams are individually flow controlled, allowing an endpoint to limit memory
commitment and to apply back pressure.  The creation of streams is also flow
controlled, with each peer declaring the maximum stream ID it is willing to
accept at a given time.

An alternative view of QUIC streams is as an elastic "message" abstraction,
similar to the way ephemeral streams are used in SST
{{?SST=DOI.10.1145/1282427.1282421}}, which may be a more appealing description
for some applications.


## Stream Identifiers {#stream-id}

Streams are identified by an unsigned 62-bit integer, referred to as the Stream
ID.  The least significant two bits of the Stream ID are used to identify the
type of stream (unidirectional or bidirectional) and the initiator of the
stream.

The least significant bit (0x1) of the Stream ID identifies the initiator of the
stream.  Clients initiate even-numbered streams (those with the least
significant bit set to 0); servers initiate odd-numbered streams (with the bit
set to 1).  Separation of the stream identifiers ensures that client and server
are able to open streams without the latency imposed by negotiating for an
identifier.

If an endpoint receives a frame for a stream that it expects to initiate (i.e.,
odd-numbered for the client or even-numbered for the server), but which it has
not yet opened, it MUST close the connection with error code STREAM_STATE_ERROR.

The second least significant bit (0x2) of the Stream ID differentiates between
unidirectional streams and bidirectional streams. Unidirectional streams always
have this bit set to 1 and bidirectional streams have this bit set to 0.

The two type bits from a Stream ID therefore identify streams as summarized in
{{stream-id-types}}.

| Low Bits | Stream Type                      |
|:---------|:---------------------------------|
| 0x0      | Client-Initiated, Bidirectional  |
| 0x1      | Server-Initiated, Bidirectional  |
| 0x2      | Client-Initiated, Unidirectional |
| 0x3      | Server-Initiated, Unidirectional |
{: #stream-id-types title="Stream ID Types"}

Stream ID 0 (0x0) is a client-initiated, bidirectional stream that is used for
the cryptographic handshake.  Stream 0 MUST NOT be used for application data.

A QUIC endpoint MUST NOT reuse a Stream ID.  Open streams can be used in any
order.  Streams that are used out of order result in opening all lower-numbered
streams of the same type in the same direction.

Stream IDs are encoded as a variable-length integer (see {{integer-encoding}}).


## Stream States {#stream-states}

This section describes the two types of QUIC stream in terms of the states of
their send or receive components.  Two state machines are described: one for
streams on which an endpoint transmits data ({{stream-send-states}}); another
for streams from which an endpoint receives data ({{stream-recv-states}}).

Unidirectional streams use the applicable state machine directly.  Bidirectional
streams use both state machines.  For the most part, the use of these state
machines is the same whether the stream is unidirectional or bidirectional.  The
conditions for opening a stream are slightly more complex for a bidirectional
stream because the opening of either send or receive causes the stream to open
in both directions.

Opening a stream causes all lower-numbered streams of the same type to
implicitly open.  This includes both send and receive streams if the stream is
bidirectional.  For bidirectional streams, an endpoint can send data on an
implicitly opened stream.  On both unidirectional and bidirectional streams, an
endpoint MAY send MAX_STREAM_DATA or STOP_SENDING on implicitly opened streams.
An endpoint SHOULD NOT implicitly open streams that it initiates, instead
opening streams in order.

Note:

: These states are largely informative.  This document uses stream states to
  describe rules for when and how different types of frames can be sent and the
  reactions that are expected when different types of frames are received.
  Though these state machines are intended to be useful in implementing QUIC,
  these states aren't intended to constrain implementations.  An implementation
  can define a different state machine as long as its behavior is consistent
  with an implementation that implements these states.


### Send Stream States {#stream-send-states}

data to a peer.

{: #fig-stream-send-states title="States for Send Streams"}

The sending part of stream that the endpoint initiates (types 0 and 2 for
clients, 1 and 3 for servers) is opened by the application or application
protocol.  The "Open" state represents a newly created stream that is able to
accept data from the application.  Stream data might be buffered in this state
in preparation for sending.

The sending part of a bidirectional stream initiated by a peer (type 0 for a
server, type 1 for a client) enters the "Open" state if the receiving part
enters the "Recv" state.

Sending the first STREAM or STREAM_BLOCKED frame causes a send stream to enter
the "Send" state.  An implementation might choose to defer allocating a Stream
ID to a send stream until it sends the first frame and enters this state, which
can allow for better stream prioritization.

In the "Send" state, an endpoint transmits - and retransmits as necessary - data
in STREAM frames.  The endpoint respects the flow control limits of its peer,
accepting MAX_STREAM_DATA frames.  An endpoint in the "Send" state generates
STREAM_BLOCKED frames if it encounters flow control limits.

After the application indicates that stream data is complete and a STREAM frame
containing the FIN bit is sent, the send stream enters the "Data Sent" state.
From this state, the endpoint only retransmits stream data as necessary.  The
endpoint no longer needs to track flow control limits or send STREAM_BLOCKED
frames for a send stream in this state.  The endpoint can ignore any
MAX_STREAM_DATA frames it receives from its peer in this state; MAX_STREAM_DATA
frames might be received until the peer receives the final stream offset.

Once all stream data has been successfully acknowledged, the send stream enters
the "Data Recvd" state, which is a terminal state.

From any of the "Open", "Send", or "Data Sent" states, an application can signal
that it wishes to abandon transmission of stream data.  Similarly, the endpoint
might receive a STOP_SENDING frame from its peer.  In either case, the endpoint
sends a RST_STREAM frame, which causes the stream to enter the "Reset Sent"
state.

An endpoint MAY send a RST_STREAM as the first frame on a send stream; this
causes the send stream to open and then immediately transition to the "Reset
Sent" state.

Once a packet containing a RST_STREAM has been acknowledged, the send stream
enters the "Reset Recvd" state, which is a terminal state.


### Receive Stream States {#stream-recv-states}

{{fig-stream-recv-states}} shows the states for the part of a stream that
receives data from a peer.  The states for a receive stream mirror only some of
the states of the send stream at the peer.  A receive stream doesn't track
states on the send stream that cannot be observed, such as the "Open" state;
instead, receive streams track the delivery of data to the application or
application protocol some of which cannot be observed by the sender.

{: #fig-stream-recv-states title="States for Receive Streams"}

The receiving part of a stream initiated by a peer (types 1 and 3 for a client,
or 0 and 2 for a server) are created when the first STREAM, STREAM_BLOCKED,
RST_STREAM, or MAX_STREAM_DATA (bidirectional only, see below) is received for
that stream.  The initial state for a receive stream is "Recv".  Receiving a
RST_STREAM frame causes the receive stream to immediately transition to the
"Reset Recvd".

The receive stream enters the "Recv" state when the sending part of a
bidirectional stream initiated by the endpoint (type 0 for a client, type 1 for
a server) enters the "Open" state.

A bidirectional stream also opens when a MAX_STREAM_DATA frame is received.
Receiving a MAX_STREAM_DATA frame implies that the remote peer has opened the
stream and is providing flow control credit.  A MAX_STREAM_DATA frame might
arrive before a STREAM or STREAM_BLOCKED frame if packets are lost or reordered.

In the "Recv" state, the endpoint receives STREAM and STREAM_BLOCKED frames.
Incoming data is buffered and can be reassembled into the correct order for
delivery to the application.  As data is consumed by the application and buffer
space becomes available, the endpoint sends MAX_STREAM_DATA frames to allow the
peer to send more data.

When a STREAM frame with a FIN bit is received, the final offset (see
{{final-offset}}) is known.  The receive stream enters the "Size Known" state.
In this state, the endpoint no longer needs to send MAX_STREAM_DATA frames, it
only receives any retransmissions of stream data.

Once all data for the stream has been received, the receive stream enters the
"Data Recvd" state.  This might happen as a result of receiving the same STREAM
frame that causes the transition to "Size Known".  In this state, the endpoint
has all stream data.  Any STREAM or STREAM_BLOCKED frames it receives for the
stream can be discarded.

The "Data Recvd" state persists until stream data has been delivered to the
application or application protocol.  Once stream data has been delivered, the
stream enters the "Data Read" state, which is a terminal state.

Receiving a RST_STREAM frame in the "Recv" or "Size Known" states causes the
stream to enter the "Reset Recvd" state.  This might cause the delivery of
stream data to the application to be interrupted.

It is possible that all stream data is received when a RST_STREAM is received
(that is, from the "Data Recvd" state).  Similarly, it is possible for remaining
stream data to arrive after receiving a RST_STREAM frame (the "Reset Recvd"
state).  An implementation is able to manage this situation as they choose.
Sending RST_STREAM means that an endpoint cannot guarantee delivery of stream
data; however there is no requirement that stream data not be delivered if a
RST_STREAM is received.  An implementation MAY interrupt delivery of stream
data, discard any data that was not consumed, and signal the existence of the
RST_STREAM immediately.  Alternatively, the RST_STREAM signal might be
suppressed or withheld if stream data is completely received.  In the latter
case, the receive stream effectively transitions to "Data Recvd" from "Reset
Recvd".

Once the application has been delivered the signal indicating that the receive
stream was reset, the receive stream transitions to the "Reset Read" state,
which is a terminal state.


### Permitted Frame Types

The sender of a stream sends just three frame types that affect the state of a
stream at either sender or receiver: STREAM ({{frame-stream}}), STREAM_BLOCKED
({{frame-stream-blocked}}), and RST_STREAM ({{frame-rst-stream}}).

A sender MUST NOT send any of these frames from a terminal state ("Data Recvd"
or "Reset Recvd").  A sender MUST NOT send STREAM or STREAM_BLOCKED after
sending a RST_STREAM; that is, in the "Reset Sent" state in addition to the
terminal states.  A receiver could receive any of these frames in any state, but
only due to the possibility of delayed delivery of packets carrying them.

The receiver of a stream sends MAX_STREAM_DATA ({{frame-max-stream-data}}) and
STOP_SENDING frames ({{frame-stop-sending}}).

The receiver only sends MAX_STREAM_DATA in the "Recv" state.  A receiver can
send STOP_SENDING in any state where it has not received a RST_STREAM frame;
that is states other than "Reset Recvd" or "Reset Read".  However there is
little value in sending a STOP_SENDING frame after all stream data has been
received in the "Data Recvd" state.  A sender could receive these frames in any
state as a result of delayed delivery of packets.


### Bidirectional Stream States {#stream-bidi-states}

A bidirectional stream is composed of a send stream and a receive stream.
Implementations may represent states of the bidirectional stream as composites
of send and receive stream states.  The simplest model presents the stream as
"open" when either send or receive stream is in a non-terminal state and
"closed" when both send and receive streams are in a terminal state.

{{stream-bidi-mapping}} shows a more complex mapping of bidirectional stream
states that loosely correspond to the stream states in HTTP/2
{{?HTTP2=RFC7540}}.  This shows that multiple states on send or receive streams
are mapped to the same composite state.  Note that this is just one possibility
for such a mapping; this mapping requires that data is acknowledged before the
transition to a "closed" or "half-closed" state.

| Send Stream            | Receive Stream         | Composite State      |
|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|:---------------------|
| No Stream/Open         | No Stream/Recv *1      | idle                 |
| Open/Send/Data Sent    | Recv/Size Known        | open                 |
| Open/Send/Data Sent    | Data Recvd/Data Read   | half-closed (remote) |
| Open/Send/Data Sent    | Reset Recvd/Reset Read | half-closed (remote) |
| Data Recvd             | Recv/Size Known        | half-closed (local)  |
| Reset Sent/Reset Recvd | Recv/Size Known        | half-closed (local)  |
| Data Recvd             | Recv/Size Known        | half-closed (local)  |
| Reset Sent/Reset Recvd | Data Recvd/Data Read   | closed               |
| Reset Sent/Reset Recvd | Reset Recvd/Reset Read | closed               |
| Data Recvd             | Data Recvd/Data Read   | closed               |
| Data Recvd             | Reset Recvd/Reset Read | closed               |
{: #stream-bidi-mapping title="Possible Mapping of Stream States to HTTP/2"}

Note (*1):

: A stream is considered "idle" if it has not yet been created, or if the
  receive stream is in the "Recv" state without yet having received any frames.


## Solicited State Transitions

If an endpoint is no longer interested in the data it is receiving on a stream,
it MAY send a STOP_SENDING frame identifying that stream to prompt closure of
the stream in the opposite direction.  This typically indicates that the
receiving application is no longer reading data it receives from the stream, but
is not a guarantee that incoming data will be ignored.

STREAM frames received after sending STOP_SENDING are still counted toward the
connection and stream flow-control windows, even though these frames will be
discarded upon receipt.  This avoids potential ambiguity about which STREAM
frames count toward flow control.

A STOP_SENDING frame requests that the receiving endpoint send a RST_STREAM
frame.  An endpoint that receives a STOP_SENDING frame MUST send a RST_STREAM
frame for that stream, and can use an error code of STOPPING.  If the
STOP_SENDING frame is received on a send stream that is already in the "Data
Sent" state, a RST_STREAM frame MAY still be sent in order to cancel
retransmission of previously-sent STREAM frames.

STOP_SENDING SHOULD only be sent for a receive stream that has not been
reset. STOP_SENDING is most useful for streams in the "Recv" or "Size Known"
states.

An endpoint is expected to send another STOP_SENDING frame if a packet
containing a previous STOP_SENDING is lost.  However, once either all stream
data or a RST_STREAM frame has been received for the stream - that is, the
stream is in any state other than "Recv" or "Size Known" - sending a
STOP_SENDING frame is unnecessary.


## Stream Concurrency {#stream-concurrency}

An endpoint limits the number of concurrently active incoming streams by
adjusting the maximum stream ID.  An initial value is set in the transport
parameters (see {{transport-parameter-definitions}}) and is subsequently
increased by MAX_STREAM_ID frames (see {{frame-max-stream-id}}).

The maximum stream ID is specific to each endpoint and applies only to the peer
that receives the setting. That is, clients specify the maximum stream ID the
server can initiate, and servers specify the maximum stream ID the client can
initiate.  Each endpoint may respond on streams initiated by the other peer,
regardless of whether it is permitted to initiated new streams.

Endpoints MUST NOT exceed the limit set by their peer.  An endpoint that
receives a STREAM frame with an ID greater than the limit it has sent MUST treat
this as a stream error of type STREAM_ID_ERROR ({{error-handling}}), unless this
is a result of a change in the initial offsets (see {{zerortt-parameters}}).

A receiver MUST NOT renege on an advertisement; that is, once a receiver
advertises a stream ID via a MAX_STREAM_ID frame, it MUST NOT subsequently
advertise a smaller maximum ID.  A sender may receive MAX_STREAM_ID frames out
of order; a sender MUST therefore ignore any MAX_STREAM_ID that does not
increase the maximum.

## Sending and Receiving Data

Once a stream is created, endpoints may use the stream to send and receive data.
Each endpoint may send a series of STREAM frames encapsulating data on a stream
until the stream is terminated in that direction.  Streams are an ordered
byte-stream abstraction, and they have no other structure within them.  STREAM
frame boundaries are not expected to be preserved in retransmissions from the
sender or during delivery to the application at the receiver.

When new data is to be sent on a stream, a sender MUST set the encapsulating
STREAM frame's offset field to the stream offset of the first byte of this new
data.  The first octet of data on a stream has an offset of 0.  An endpoint is
expected to send every stream octet.  The largest offset delivered on a stream
MUST be less than 2^62. A receiver MUST ensure that received stream data is
delivered to the application as an ordered byte-stream.  Data received out of
order MUST be buffered for later delivery, as long as it is not in violation of
the receiver's flow control limits.

An endpoint MUST NOT send data on any stream without ensuring that it is within
the data limits set by its peer.  The cryptographic handshake stream, Stream 0,
is exempt from the connection-level data limits established by MAX_DATA. Data on
stream 0 other than the initial cryptographic handshake message is still subject
to stream-level data limits and MAX_STREAM_DATA. This message is exempt from
flow control because it needs to be sent in a single packet regardless of the
server's flow control state. This rule applies even for 0-RTT handshakes where
the remembered value of MAX_STREAM_DATA would not permit sending a full initial
cryptographic handshake message.

Flow control is described in detail in {{flow-control}}, and congestion control
is described in the companion document {{QUIC-RECOVERY}}.


## Stream Prioritization

Stream multiplexing has a significant effect on application performance if
resources allocated to streams are correctly prioritized.  Experience with other
multiplexed protocols, such as HTTP/2 {{?HTTP2}}, shows that effective
prioritization strategies have a significant positive impact on performance.

QUIC does not provide frames for exchanging prioritization information.  Instead
it relies on receiving priority information from the application that uses QUIC.
Protocols that use QUIC are able to define any prioritization scheme that suits
their application semantics.  A protocol might define explicit messages for
signaling priority, such as those defined in HTTP/2; it could define rules that
allow an endpoint to determine priority based on context; or it could leave the
determination to the application.

A QUIC implementation SHOULD provide ways in which an application can indicate
the relative priority of streams.  When deciding which streams to dedicate
resources to, QUIC SHOULD use the information provided by the application.
Failure to account for priority of streams can result in suboptimal performance.

Stream priority is most relevant when deciding which stream data will be
transmitted.  Often, there will be limits on what can be transmitted as a result
of connection flow control or the current congestion controller state.

Giving preference to the transmission of its own management frames ensures that
the protocol functions efficiently.  That is, prioritizing frames other than
STREAM frames ensures that loss recovery, congestion control, and flow control
operate effectively.

Stream 0 MUST be prioritized over other streams prior to the completion of the
cryptographic handshake.  This includes the retransmission of the second flight
of client handshake messages, that is, the TLS Finished and any client
authentication messages.

STREAM frames that are determined to be lost SHOULD be retransmitted before
sending new data, unless application priorities indicate otherwise.
Retransmitting lost stream data can fill in gaps, which allows the peer to
consume already received data and free up flow control window.


# Flow Control {#flow-control}

It is necessary to limit the amount of data that a sender may have outstanding
at any time, so as to prevent a fast sender from overwhelming a slow receiver,
or to prevent a malicious sender from consuming significant resources at a
receiver.  This section describes QUIC's flow-control mechanisms.

QUIC employs a credit-based flow-control scheme similar to HTTP/2's flow control
{{?HTTP2}}.  A receiver advertises the number of octets it is prepared to
receive on a given stream and for the entire connection.  This leads to two
levels of flow control in QUIC: (i) Connection flow control, which prevents
senders from exceeding a receiver's buffer capacity for the connection, and (ii)
Stream flow control, which prevents a single stream from consuming the entire
receive buffer for a connection.

A data receiver sends MAX_STREAM_DATA or MAX_DATA frames to the sender
to advertise additional credit. MAX_STREAM_DATA frames send the the
maximum absolute byte offset of a stream, while MAX_DATA sends the
maximum sum of the absolute byte offsets of all streams other than
stream 0.

A receiver MAY advertise a larger offset at any point by sending MAX_DATA or
MAX_STREAM_DATA frames.  A receiver MUST NOT renege on an advertisement; that
is, once a receiver advertises an offset, it MUST NOT subsequently advertise a
smaller offset.  A sender could receive MAX_DATA or MAX_STREAM_DATA frames out
of order; a sender MUST therefore ignore any flow control offset that does not
move the window forward.

A receiver MUST close the connection with a FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR error
({{error-handling}}) if the peer violates the advertised connection or stream
data limits.

A sender SHOULD send BLOCKED or STREAM_BLOCKED frames to indicate it has data to
write but is blocked by flow control limits.  These frames are expected to be
sent infrequently in common cases, but they are considered useful for debugging
and monitoring purposes.

A receiver advertises credit for a stream by sending a MAX_STREAM_DATA frame
with the Stream ID set appropriately. A receiver could use the current offset of
data consumed to determine the flow control offset to be advertised.  A receiver
MAY send MAX_STREAM_DATA frames in multiple packets in order to make sure that
the sender receives an update before running out of flow control credit, even if
one of the packets is lost.

Connection flow control is a limit to the total bytes of stream data sent in
STREAM frames on all streams except stream 0.  A receiver advertises credit for
a connection by sending a MAX_DATA frame.  A receiver maintains a cumulative sum
of bytes received on all contributing streams, which are used to check for flow
control violations. A receiver might use a sum of bytes consumed on all
contributing streams to determine the maximum data limit to be advertised.

## Edge Cases and Other Considerations

There are some edge cases which must be considered when dealing with stream and
connection level flow control.  Given enough time, both endpoints must agree on
flow control state.  If one end believes it can send more than the other end is
willing to receive, the connection will be torn down when too much data arrives.

Conversely if a sender believes it is blocked, while endpoint B expects more
data can be received, then the connection can be in a deadlock, with the sender
waiting for a MAX_DATA or MAX_STREAM_DATA frame which will never come.

On receipt of a RST_STREAM frame, an endpoint will tear down state for the
matching stream and ignore further data arriving on that stream.  This could
result in the endpoints getting out of sync, since the RST_STREAM frame may have
arrived out of order and there may be further bytes in flight.  The data sender
would have counted the data against its connection level flow control budget,
but a receiver that has not received these bytes would not know to include them
as well.  The receiver must learn the number of bytes that were sent on the
stream to make the same adjustment in its connection flow controller.

To avoid this de-synchronization, a RST_STREAM sender MUST include the final
byte offset sent on the stream in the RST_STREAM frame.  On receiving a
RST_STREAM frame, a receiver definitively knows how many bytes were sent on that
stream before the RST_STREAM frame, and the receiver MUST use the final offset
to account for all bytes sent on the stream in its connection level flow
controller.

### Response to a RST_STREAM

RST_STREAM terminates one direction of a stream abruptly.  Whether any action or
response can or should be taken on the data already received is an
application-specific issue, but it will often be the case that upon receipt of a
RST_STREAM an endpoint will choose to stop sending data in its own direction. If
the sender of a RST_STREAM wishes to explicitly state that no future data will
be processed, that endpoint MAY send a STOP_SENDING frame at the same time.

### Data Limit Increments {#fc-credit}

This document leaves when and how many bytes to advertise in a MAX_DATA or
MAX_STREAM_DATA to implementations, but offers a few considerations.  These
frames contribute to connection overhead.  Therefore frequently sending frames
with small changes is undesirable.  At the same time, infrequent updates require
larger increments to limits if blocking is to be avoided.  Thus, larger updates
require a receiver to commit to larger resource commitments.  Thus there is a
tradeoff between resource commitment and overhead when determining how large a
limit is advertised.

A receiver MAY use an autotuning mechanism to tune the frequency and amount that
it increases data limits based on a roundtrip time estimate and the rate at
which the receiving application consumes data, similar to common TCP
implementations.

### Handshake Exemption

During the initial handshake, an endpoint could need to send a larger message on
stream 0 than would ordinarily be permitted by the peer's initial stream flow
control window. Since MAX_STREAM_DATA frames are not permitted in these early
packets, the peer cannot provide additional flow control window in order to
complete the handshake.

Endpoints MAY exceed the flow control limits on stream 0 prior to the completion
of the cryptographic handshake.  (That is, in Initial, Retry, and Handshake
packets.)  However, once the handshake is complete, endpoints MUST NOT send
additional data beyond the peer's permitted offset.  If the amount of data sent
during the handshake exceeds the peer's maximum offset, the endpoint cannot send
additional data on stream 0 until the peer has sent a MAX_STREAM_DATA frame
indicating a larger maximum offset.

## Stream Limit Increment

As with flow control, this document leaves when and how many streams to make
available to a peer via MAX_STREAM_ID to implementations, but offers a few
considerations.  MAX_STREAM_ID frames constitute minimal overhead, while
withholding MAX_STREAM_ID frames can prevent the peer from using the available
parallelism.

Implementations will likely want to increase the maximum stream ID as
peer-initiated streams close.  A receiver MAY also advance the maximum stream ID
based on current activity, system conditions, and other environmental factors.


### Blocking on Flow Control {#blocking}

If a sender does not receive a MAX_DATA or MAX_STREAM_DATA frame when it has run
out of flow control credit, the sender will be blocked and SHOULD send a BLOCKED
or STREAM_BLOCKED frame.  These frames are expected to be useful for debugging
at the receiver; they do not require any other action.  A receiver SHOULD NOT
wait for a BLOCKED or STREAM_BLOCKED frame before sending MAX_DATA or
MAX_STREAM_DATA, since doing so will mean that a sender is unable to send for an
entire round trip.

For smooth operation of the congestion controller, it is generally considered
best to not let the sender go into quiescence if avoidable.  To avoid blocking a
sender, and to reasonably account for the possibiity of loss, a receiver should
send a MAX_DATA or MAX_STREAM_DATA frame at least two roundtrips before it
expects the sender to get blocked.

A sender sends a single BLOCKED or STREAM_BLOCKED frame only once when it
reaches a data limit.  A sender SHOULD NOT send multiple BLOCKED or
STREAM_BLOCKED frames for the same data limit, unless the original frame is
determined to be lost.  Another BLOCKED or STREAM_BLOCKED frame can be sent
after the data limit is increased.


## Stream Final Offset {#final-offset}

The final offset is the count of the number of octets that are transmitted on a
stream.  For a stream that is reset, the final offset is carried explicitly in
a RST_STREAM frame.  Otherwise, the final offset is the offset of the end of the
data carried in a STREAM frame marked with a FIN flag, or 0 in the case of
incoming unidirectional streams.

An endpoint will know the final offset for a stream when the receive stream
enters the "Size Known" or "Reset Recvd" state.

An endpoint MUST NOT send data on a stream at or beyond the final offset.

Once a final offset for a stream is known, it cannot change.  If a RST_STREAM or
STREAM frame causes the final offset to change for a stream, an endpoint SHOULD
respond with a FINAL_OFFSET_ERROR error (see {{error-handling}}).  A receiver
SHOULD treat receipt of data at or beyond the final offset as a
FINAL_OFFSET_ERROR error, even after a stream is closed.  Generating these
errors is not mandatory, but only because requiring that an endpoint generate
these errors also means that the endpoint needs to maintain the final offset
state for closed streams, which could mean a significant state commitment.


# Error Handling

An endpoint that detects an error SHOULD signal the existence of that error to
its peer.  Errors can affect an entire connection (see {{connection-errors}}),
or a single stream (see {{stream-errors}}).

The most appropriate error code ({{error-codes}}) SHOULD be included in the
frame that signals the error.  Where this specification identifies error
conditions, it also identifies the error code that is used.

A stateless reset ({{stateless-reset}}) is not suitable for any error that can
be signaled with a CONNECTION_CLOSE, APPLICATION_CLOSE, or RST_STREAM frame.  A
stateless reset MUST NOT be used by an endpoint that has the state necessary to
send a frame on the connection.


## Connection Errors

Errors that result in the connection being unusable, such as an obvious
violation of protocol semantics or corruption of state that affects an entire
connection, MUST be signaled using a CONNECTION_CLOSE or APPLICATION_CLOSE frame
({{frame-connection-close}}, {{frame-application-close}}). An endpoint MAY close
the connection in this manner even if the error only affects a single stream.

Application protocols can signal application-specific protocol errors using the
APPLICATION_CLOSE frame.  Errors that are specific to the transport, including
all those described in this document, are carried in a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame.
Other than the type of error code they carry, these frames are identical in
format and semantics.

A CONNECTION_CLOSE or APPLICATION_CLOSE frame could be sent in a packet that is
lost.  An endpoint SHOULD be prepared to retransmit a packet containing either
frame type if it receives more packets on a terminated connection.  Limiting the
number of retransmissions and the time over which this final packet is sent
limits the effort expended on terminated connections.

An endpoint that chooses not to retransmit packets containing CONNECTION_CLOSE
or APPLICATION_CLOSE risks a peer missing the first such packet.  The only
mechanism available to an endpoint that continues to receive data for a
terminated connection is to use the stateless reset process
({{stateless-reset}}).

An endpoint that receives an invalid CONNECTION_CLOSE or APPLICATION_CLOSE frame
MUST NOT signal the existence of the error to its peer.


## Stream Errors

If the error affects a single stream, but otherwise leaves the connection in a
recoverable state, the endpoint can send a RST_STREAM frame
({{frame-rst-stream}}) with an appropriate error code to terminate just the
affected stream.

Stream 0 is critical to the functioning of the entire connection.  If stream 0
is closed with either a RST_STREAM or STREAM frame bearing the FIN flag, an
endpoint MUST generate a connection error of type PROTOCOL_VIOLATION.

RST_STREAM MUST be instigated by the application and MUST carry an application
error code.  Resetting a stream without knowledge of the application protocol
could cause the protocol to enter an unrecoverable state.  Application protocols
might require certain streams to be reliably delivered in order to guarantee
consistent state between endpoints.


## Transport Error Codes {#error-codes}

QUIC error codes are 16-bit unsigned integers.

This section lists the defined QUIC transport error codes that may be used in a
CONNECTION_CLOSE frame.  These errors apply to the entire connection.

NO_ERROR (0x0):

: An endpoint uses this with CONNECTION_CLOSE to signal that the connection is
  being closed abruptly in the absence of any error.

INTERNAL_ERROR (0x1):

: The endpoint encountered an internal error and cannot continue with the
  connection.

SERVER_BUSY (0x2):

: The server is currently busy and does not accept any new connections.

FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR (0x3):

: An endpoint received more data than it permitted in its advertised data limits
  (see {{flow-control}}).

STREAM_ID_ERROR (0x4):

: An endpoint received a frame for a stream identifier that exceeded its
  advertised maximum stream ID.

STREAM_STATE_ERROR (0x5):

: An endpoint received a frame for a stream that was not in a state that
  permitted that frame (see {{stream-states}}).

FINAL_OFFSET_ERROR (0x6):

: An endpoint received a STREAM frame containing data that exceeded the
  previously established final offset.  Or an endpoint received a RST_STREAM
  frame containing a final offset that was lower than the maximum offset of data
  that was already received.  Or an endpoint received a RST_STREAM frame
  containing a different final offset to the one already established.

FRAME_FORMAT_ERROR (0x7):

: An endpoint received a frame that was badly formatted.  For instance, an empty
  STREAM frame that omitted the FIN flag, or an ACK frame that has more
  acknowledgment ranges than the remainder of the packet could carry.  This is a
  generic error code; an endpoint SHOULD use the more specific frame format
  error codes (0x1XX) if possible.

TRANSPORT_PARAMETER_ERROR (0x8):

: An endpoint received transport parameters that were badly formatted, included
  an invalid value, was absent even though it is mandatory, was present though
  it is forbidden, or is otherwise in error.

VERSION_NEGOTIATION_ERROR (0x9):

: An endpoint received transport parameters that contained version negotiation
  parameters that disagreed with the version negotiation that it performed.
  This error code indicates a potential version downgrade attack.

PROTOCOL_VIOLATION (0xA):

: An endpoint detected an error with protocol compliance that was not covered by
  more specific error codes.

UNSOLICITED_PATH_RESPONSE (0xB):

: An endpoint received a PATH_RESPONSE frame that did not correspond to any
  PATH_CHALLENGE frame that it previously sent.

FRAME_ERROR (0x1XX):

: An endpoint detected an error in a specific frame type.  The frame type is
  included as the last octet of the error code.  For example, an error in a
  MAX_STREAM_ID frame would be indicated with the code (0x106).

Codes for errors occuring when TLS is used for the crypto handshake are defined
in Section 11 of {{QUIC-TLS}}. See {{iana-error-codes}} for details of
registering new error codes.


## Application Protocol Error Codes {#app-error-codes}

Application protocol error codes are 16-bit unsigned integers, but the
management of application error codes are left to application protocols.
Application protocol error codes are used for the RST_STREAM
({{frame-rst-stream}}) and APPLICATION_CLOSE ({{frame-application-close}})
frames.

There is no restriction on the use of the 16-bit error code space for
application protocols.  However, QUIC reserves the error code with a value of 0
to mean STOPPING.  The application error code of STOPPING (0) is used by the
transport to cancel a stream in response to receipt of a STOP_SENDING frame.


# Security and Privacy Considerations

## Spoofed ACK Attack

An attacker might be able to receive an address validation token
({{address-validation}}) from the server and then release the IP address it
used to acquire that token.  The attacker may, in the future, spoof this same
address (which now presumably addresses a different endpoint), and initiate a
0-RTT connection with a server on the victim's behalf.  The attacker can then
spoof ACK frames to the server which cause the server to send excessive amounts
of data toward the new owner of the IP address.

There are two possible mitigations to this attack.  The simplest one is that a
server can unilaterally create a gap in packet-number space.  In the non-attack
scenario, the client will send an ACK frame with the larger value for largest
acknowledged.  In the attack scenario, the attacker could acknowledge a packet
in the gap.  If the server sees an acknowledgment for a packet that was never
sent, the connection can be aborted.

The second mitigation is that the server can require that acknowledgments for
sent packets match the encryption level of the sent packet.  This mitigation is
useful if the connection has an ephemeral forward-secure key that is generated
and used for every new connection.  If a packet sent is protected with a
forward-secure key, then any acknowledgments that are received for them MUST
also be forward-secure protected.  Since the attacker will not have the forward
secure key, the attacker will not be able to generate forward-secure protected
packets with ACK frames.


## Slowloris Attacks

The attacks commonly known as Slowloris {{SLOWLORIS}} try to keep many
connections to the target endpoint open and hold them open as long as possible.
These attacks can be executed against a QUIC endpoint by generating the minimum
amount of activity necessary to avoid being closed for inactivity.  This might
involve sending small amounts of data, gradually opening flow control windows in
order to control the sender rate, or manufacturing ACK frames that simulate a
high loss rate.

QUIC deployments SHOULD provide mitigations for the Slowloris attacks, such as
increasing the maximum number of clients the server will allow, limiting the
number of connections a single IP address is allowed to make, imposing
restrictions on the minimum transfer speed a connection is allowed to have, and
restricting the length of time an endpoint is allowed to stay connected.


## Stream Fragmentation and Reassembly Attacks

An adversarial endpoint might intentionally fragment the data on stream buffers
in order to cause disproportionate memory commitment.  An adversarial endpoint
could open a stream and send some STREAM frames containing arbitrary fragments
of the stream content.

The attack is mitigated if flow control windows correspond to available
memory.  However, some receivers will over-commit memory and advertise flow
control offsets in the aggregate that exceed actual available memory.  The
over-commitment strategy can lead to better performance when endpoints are well
behaved, but renders endpoints vulnerable to the stream fragmentation attack.

QUIC deployments SHOULD provide mitigations against the stream fragmentation
attack.  Mitigations could consist of avoiding over-committing memory, delaying
reassembly of STREAM frames, implementing heuristics based on the age and
duration of reassembly holes, or some combination.


## Stream Commitment Attack

An adversarial endpoint can open lots of streams, exhausting state on an
endpoint.  The adversarial endpoint could repeat the process on a large number
of connections, in a manner similar to SYN flooding attacks in TCP.

Normally, clients will open streams sequentially, as explained in {{stream-id}}.
However, when several streams are initiated at short intervals, transmission
error may cause STREAM DATA frames opening streams to be received out of
sequence.  A receiver is obligated to open intervening streams if a
higher-numbered stream ID is received.  Thus, on a new connection, opening
stream 2000001 opens 1 million streams, as required by the specification.

The number of active streams is limited by the concurrent stream limit transport
parameter, as explained in {{stream-concurrency}}.  If chosen judisciously, this
limit mitigates the effect of the stream commitment attack.  However, setting
the limit too low could affect performance when applications expect to open
large number of streams.


# IANA Considerations

## QUIC Transport Parameter Registry {#iana-transport-parameters}

IANA \[SHALL add/has added] a registry for "QUIC Transport Parameters" under a
"QUIC Protocol" heading.

The "QUIC Transport Parameters" registry governs a 16-bit space.  This space is
split into two spaces that are governed by different policies.  Values with the
first byte in the range 0x00 to 0xfe (in hexadecimal) are assigned via the
Specification Required policy {{!RFC8126}}.  Values with the first byte 0xff are
reserved for Private Use {{!RFC8126}}.

Registrations MUST include the following fields:

Value:

: The numeric value of the assignment (registrations will be between 0x0000 and
  0xfeff).

Parameter Name:

: A short mnemonic for the parameter.

Specification:

: A reference to a publicly available specification for the value.


The nominated expert(s) verify that a specification exists and is readily
accessible.  The expert(s) are encouraged to be biased towards approving
registrations unless they are abusive, frivolous, or actively harmful (not
merely aesthetically displeasing, or architecturally dubious).

The initial contents of this registry are shown in {{iana-tp-table}}.
