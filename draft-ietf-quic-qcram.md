# Introduction

The QUIC transport protocol was designed from the outset to support HTTP
semantics, and its design subsumes many of the features of HTTP/2.  QUIC's
stream multiplexing comes into some conflict with  header compression.  A key
goal of the design of QUIC is to improve stream multiplexing relative to HTTP/2
by eliminating HoL (head of line) blocking, which can occur in HTTP/2.  HoL
blocking can happen because all HTTP/2 streams are multiplexed onto a single TCP
connection with its in-order semantics.  QUIC can maintain independence between
streams because it implements core transport functionality in a fully
stream-aware manner.  However, the HTTP/QUIC mapping is still subject to HoL
blocking if HPACK is used directly.  HPACK exploits multiplexing for greater
compression, shrinking the representation of headers that have appeared earlier
on the same connection.  In the context of QUIC, this imposes a vulnerability to
HoL blocking (see {{hol-example}}).

QUIC is described in {{?QUIC-TRANSPORT=I-D.ietf-quic-transport}}.  The HTTP/QUIC
mapping is described in {{!QUIC-HTTP=I-D.ietf-quic-http}}. For a full
description of HTTP/2, see {{?RFC7540}}. The description of HPACK is
{{!RFC7541}}, with important terminology in Section 1.3.

QCRAM modifies HPACK to allow correctness in the presence of out-of-order
delivery, with flexibility for implementations to balance between resilience
against HoL blocking and optimal compression ratio.  The design goals are to
closely approach the compression ratio of HPACK with substantially less
head-of-line blocking under the same loss conditions.

QCRAM is intended to be a relatively non-intrusive extension to HPACK; an
implementation should be easily shared within stacks supporting both HTTP/2 over
(TLS+)TCP and HTTP/QUIC.

## Head-of-Line Blocking in HPACK {#hol-example}

HPACK enables several types of header representations, one of which also adds
the header to a dynamic table of header values.  These values are then available
for reuse in subsequent header blocks simply by referencing the entry number in
the table.

If the packet containing a header is lost, that stream cannot complete header
processing until the packet is retransmitted.  This is unavoidable. However,
other streams which rely on the state created by that packet *also* cannot make
progress. This is the problem which QUIC solves in general, but which is
reintroduced by HPACK when the loss includes a HEADERS frame.

## Avoiding Head-of-Line Blocking in HTTP/QUIC {#overview-hol-avoidance}

In the example above, the second stream contained a reference to data
which might not yet have been processed by the recipient.  Such references
are called "vulnerable," because the loss of a different packet can keep
the reference from being usable.

The encoder can choose on a per-header-block basis whether to favor higher
compression ratio (by permitting vulnerable references) or HoL resilience (by
avoiding them). This is signaled by the BLOCKING flag in HEADERS and
PUSH_PROMISE frames (see {{QUIC-HTTP}}).

If a header block contains no vulnerable header fields, BLOCKING MUST be 0.
This implies that the header fields are represented either as references
to dynamic table entries which are known to have been received, or as
Literal header fields (see {{RFC7541}} Section 6.2).

If a header block contains any header field which references dynamic table
state which the peer might not have received yet, the BLOCKING flag MUST be
set.  If the peer does not yet have the appropriate state, such blocks
might not be processed on arrival.

The header block contains a prefix ({{absolute-index}}). This prefix contains
table offset information that establishes total ordering among all headers,
regardless of reordering in the transport (see {{overview-absolute}}).

In blocking mode, the prefix additionally identifies the minimum state required
to process any vulnerable references in the header block (see `Depends Index` in
{{overview-absolute}}).  The decoder keeps track of which entries have been
added to its dynamic table.  The stream for a header with BLOCKING flag set is
considered blocked by the decoder and can not be processed until all entries in
the range `[1, Depends Index]` have been added.  While blocked, header
field data MUST remain in the blocked stream's flow control window.

# HPACK extensions

## Allowed Instructions

HEADERS frames on the Control Stream SHOULD contain only Literal with
Incremental Indexing and Indexed with Duplication (see {{indexed-duplicate}})
representations.  Frames on this stream modify the dynamic table state
without generating output to any particular request.

HEADERS and PUSH_PROMISE frames on request and push streams MUST NOT contain
Literal with Incremental Indexing and Indexed with Duplication representations.
Frames on these streams reference the dynamic table in a particular state
without modifying it, but emit the headers for an HTTP request or response.

## Header Block Prefix {#absolute-index}

For request and push promise streams, in HEADERS and PUSH_PROMISE frames, HPACK
Header data is prefixed by an integer: `Base Index`.  `Base index` is the
cumulative number of entries added to the dynamic table prior to encoding the
current block, including any entries already evicted.  It is encoded as a single
8-bit prefix integer:

~~~~~~~~~~  drawing
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |Base Index (8+)|
   +---------------+
~~~~~~~~~~
{:#fig-base-index title="Absolute indexing (BLOCKING=0x0)"}

{{overview-absolute}} describes the role of `Base Index`.

When the BLOCKING flag is 0x1, a the prefix additionally contains a second HPACK
integer (8-bit prefix) 'Depends':

~~~~~~~~~~  drawing
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |Base Index (8+)|
   +---------------+
   |Depends    (8+)|
   +---------------+
~~~~~~~~~~
{:#fig-prefix-long title="Absolute indexing (BLOCKING=0x1)"}

Depends is used to identify header dependencies (see
{{overview-hol-avoidance}}).  The encoder computes a value `Depends Index` which
is the largest (absolute) index referenced by the following header block.  To
help keep the prefix smaller, `Depends Index` is converted to a relative value:
`Depends = Base Index - Depends Index`.

## Hybrid absolute-relative indexing {#overview-absolute}

HPACK indexed entries refer to an entry by its current position in the dynamic
table.  As Figure 1 of {{!RFC7541}} illustrates, newer entries have smaller
indices, and older entries are evicted first if the table is full.  Under this
scheme, each insertion to the table causes the index of all existing entries to
change (implicitly).  Implicit index updates are acceptable for HTTP/2 because
TCP is totally ordered, but are problematic in the out-of-order context of
QUIC.

QCRAM uses a hybrid absolute-relative indexing approach.

When the encoder adds a new entry to its header table, it can compute
an absolute index:

```
entry.absoluteIndex = baseIndex++;
```

Since literals with indexing are only sent on the control stream, the decoder
can be guaranteed to compute the same absolute index values when it adds
corresponding entries to its table, just as in HPACK and HTTP/2.

When encoding indexed representations, the following holds for (relative) HPACK
indices:

`relative index = baseIndex - entry.absoluteIndex + staticTable.size`

Header blocks on request and push streams do not modify the dynamic table state,
so they never change the `baseIndex`.  However, since ordering between streams
is not guaranteed, the value of `baseIndex` can not be synchronized implicitly.
Instead then, QCRAM sends encoder's `Base Index` explicitly as part of the
prefix (see {{absolute-index}}), so that the decoder can compute the same
absolute indices that the encoder used:

`absoluteIndex = prefix.baseIndex + staticTable.size - relativeIndex;`

In this way, even if request or push stream headers are decoded in a different
order than encoded, the absolute indices will still identify the correct table
entries.

It is an error if the HPACK decoder encounters an indexed representation that
refers to an entry missing from the table, and the connection MUST be closed
with the `HTTP_HPACK_DECOMPRESSION_FAILED` error code.

## Preventing Eviction Races {#evictions}

Due to out-of-order arrival, QCRAM's eviction algorithm requires changes
(relative to HPACK) to avoid the possibility that an indexed representation is
decoded after the referenced entry has already been evicted.  QCRAM employs a
two-phase eviction algorithm, in which the encoder will not evict entries that
have outstanding (unacknowledged) references.

### Blocked Evictions

The encoder MUST NOT permit an entry to be evicted while a reference to that
entry remains unacknowledged.  If a new header to be inserted into the dynamic
table would cause the eviction of such an entry, the encoder MUST NOT emit the
insert instruction until the reference has been processed by the decoder and
acknowledged.

The encoder can emit a literal representation for the new header in order to
avoid encoding delays, and MAY insert the header into the table later if
desired.

To ensure that the blocked eviction case is rare, references to the oldest
entries in the dynamic table SHOULD be avoided.  When one of the oldest entries
in the table is still actively used for references, the encoder SHOULD emit an
Indexed-Duplicate representation instead (see {{indexed-duplicate}}).

## Refreshing Entries with Duplication {#indexed-duplicate}

~~~~~~~~~~  drawing
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |0|0|1|Index(5+)|
   +-+-+-+---------+
~~~~~~~~~~
{:#fig-index-with-duplication title="Indexed Header Field with Duplication"}

*Indexed-Duplicates* insert a new entry into the dynamic table which duplicates
an existing entry. {{RFC7541}} allows duplicate HPACK table entries, that is
entries that have the same name and value.

This replaces the HPACK instruction for Dynamic Table Size Update (see Section
6.3 of {{RFC7541}}, which is not supported by HTTP over QUIC.

# Performance considerations

## Speculative table updates {#speculative-updates}

Implementations can *speculatively* send header frames on the HTTP Control
Streams which are not needed for any current HTTP request or response.  Such
headers could be used strategically to improve performance.  For instance, the
encoder might decide to *refresh* by sending Indexed-Duplicate representations
for popular header fields ({{absolute-index}}), ensuring they have small indices
and hence minimal size on the wire.

## Additional state beyond HPACK.

### Vulnerable Entries

For header blocks encoded in non-blocking mode, the encoder needs to forego
indexed representations that refer to vulnerable entries (see
{{overview-hol-avoidance}}).  An implementation could extend the header table
entry with a boolean to track vulnerability.  However, the number of entries in
the table that are vulnerable is likely to be small in practice, much less than
the total number of entries, so a data tracking only vulnerable
(un-acknowledged) entries, separate from the main header table, might be more
space efficient.

### Safe evictions

Section {{evictions}} describes how QCRAM avoids invalid references that might
result from out-of-order delivery.  When the encoder processes a HEADER_ACK, it
dereferences table entries that were indexed in the acknowledged header.  To
track which entries must be dereferenced, it can maintain a map from
unacknowledged headers to lists of (absolute) indices.  The simplest place to
store the actual reference count might be the table entries.  In practice the
number of entries in the table with a non-zero reference count is likely to stay
quite small.  A data structure tracking only entries with non-zero reference
counts, separate from the main header table, could be more space efficient.

### Decoder Blocking

To support blocking, the decoder needs to keep track of entries it has added to
the dynamic table (see {{overview-hol-avoidance}}), and it needs to track
blocked streams.

Tracking added entries might be done in a brute force fashion without additional
space.  However, this would have O(N) cost where N is the number of entries in
the dynamic table.  Alternatively, a dedicated data structure might improve on
brute force in exchange a small amount of additional space.  For example, a set
of pairs (of indices), representing non-overlapping sub-ranges can be used.
Each operation (add, or query) can be done within O(log M) complexity.  Here set
size M is the number of sub-ranges. In practice M would be very small, as most
table entries would be concentrated in the first sub-range [1, M].

To track blocked streams, an ordered map (e.g. multi-map) from `Depends Index`
values to streams can be used.  Whenever the decoder processes a header block,
it can drain any members of the blocked streams map that have `Depends
Index <= M` where `[1,M]` is the first member of the added- entries sub-ranges
set.  Again, the complexity of operations would be at most O(log N), N being
the number of concurrently blocked streams.

### Fixed overhead.

HPACK defines overhead as 32 bytes ({{!RFC7541}} Section 4.1).  As described
above, QCRAM adds some per-connection state, and possibly some per-entry state
to track acknowledgment status and eviction reference count.  A larger value
than 32 might be more accurate for QCRAM.

# Security Considerations

TBD.

# IANA Considerations

This document registers a new frame type, HEADER_ACK, for HTTP/QUIC. This will
need to be added to the IANA Considerations of {{QUIC-HTTP}}.
