# Introduction

QUIC {{QUIC-TRANSPORT}} provides a multiplexed transport.  When used for HTTP
{{!RFC7230}} semantics {{QUIC-HTTP}} it provides several key advantages over
HTTP/1.1 {{?RFC7230}} or HTTP/2 {{?RFC7540}} over TCP {{?RFC0793}}.

This document describes how QUIC can be secured using Transport Layer Security
(TLS) version 1.3 {{!I-D.ietf-tls-tls13}}.  TLS 1.3 provides critical latency
improvements for connection establishment over previous versions.  Absent packet
loss, most new connections can be established and secured within a single round
trip; on subsequent connections between the same client and server, the client
can often send application data immediately, that is, using a zero round trip
setup.

This document describes how the standardized TLS 1.3 can act a security
component of QUIC.  The same design could work for TLS 1.2, though few of the
benefits QUIC provides would be realized due to the handshake latency in
versions of TLS prior to 1.3.


# Notational Conventions

The words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", and "MAY" are used in this document.
It's not shouting; when they are capitalized, they have the special meaning
defined in {{!RFC2119}}.

This document uses the terminology established in {{QUIC-TRANSPORT}}.

For brevity, the acronym TLS is used to refer to TLS 1.3.

TLS terminology is used when referring to parts of TLS. Though TLS assumes a
continuous stream of octets, it divides that stream into *records*. Most
relevant to QUIC are the records that contain TLS *handshake messages*, which
are discrete messages that are used for key agreement, authentication and
parameter negotiation. Ordinarily, TLS records can also contain *application
data*, though in the QUIC usage there is no use of TLS application data.


# Protocol Overview

QUIC {{QUIC-TRANSPORT}} assumes responsibility for the confidentiality and
integrity protection of packets.  For this it uses keys derived from a TLS 1.3
connection {{!I-D.ietf-tls-tls13}}; QUIC also relies on TLS 1.3 for
authentication and negotiation of parameters that are critical to security and
performance.

Rather than a strict layering, these two protocols are co-dependent: QUIC uses
the TLS handshake; TLS uses the reliability and ordered delivery provided by
QUIC streams.

This document defines how QUIC interacts with TLS.  This includes a description
of how TLS is used, how keying material is derived from TLS, and the application
of that keying material to protect QUIC packets.  {{schematic}} shows the basic
interactions between TLS and QUIC, with the QUIC packet protection being called
out specially.

{: #schematic title="QUIC and TLS Interactions"}

The initial state of a QUIC connection has packets exchanged without any form of
protection.  In this state, QUIC is limited to using stream 1 and associated
packets.  Stream 1 is reserved for a TLS connection.  This is a complete TLS
connection as it would appear when layered over TCP; the only difference is that
QUIC provides the reliability and ordering that would otherwise be provided by
TCP.

At certain points during the TLS handshake, keying material is exported from the
TLS connection for use by QUIC.  This keying material is used to derive packet
protection keys.  Details on how and when keys are derived and used are included
in {{packet-protection}}.

This arrangement means that some TLS messages receive redundant protection from
both the QUIC packet protection and the TLS record protection.  These messages
are limited in number; the TLS connection is rarely needed once the handshake
completes.


## TLS Overview

TLS provides two endpoints a way to establish a means of communication over an
untrusted medium (that is, the Internet) that ensures that messages they
exchange cannot be observed, modified, or forged.

TLS features can be separated into two basic functions: an authenticated key
exchange and record protection.  QUIC primarily uses the authenticated key
exchange provided by TLS but provides its own packet protection.

The TLS authenticated key exchange occurs between two entities: client and
server.  The client initiates the exchange and the server responds.  If the key
exchange completes successfully, both client and server will agree on a secret.
TLS supports both pre-shared key (PSK) and Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchanges.
PSK is the basis for 0-RTT; the latter provides perfect forward secrecy (PFS)
when the DH keys are destroyed.

After completing the TLS handshake, the client will have learned and
authenticated an identity for the server and the server is optionally able to
learn and authenticate an identity for the client.  TLS supports X.509
certificate-based authentication {{?RFC5280}} for both server and client.

The TLS key exchange is resistent to tampering by attackers and it produces
shared secrets that cannot be controlled by either participating peer.


## TLS Handshake

TLS 1.3 provides two basic handshake modes of interest to QUIC:

 * A full, 1-RTT handshake in which the client is able to send application data
   after one round trip and the server immediately after receiving the first
   handshake message from the client.

 * A 0-RTT handshake in which the client uses information it has previously
   learned about the server to send immediately.  This data can be replayed by
   an attacker so it MUST NOT carry a self-contained trigger for any
   non-idempotent action.

A simplified TLS 1.3 handshake with 0-RTT application data is shown in
{{tls-full}}, see {{!I-D.ietf-tls-tls13}} for more options and details.

~~~
    Client                                             Server

    ClientHello
   (0-RTT Application Data)  -------->
                                                  ServerHello
                                         {EncryptedExtensions}
                                                    {Finished}
                             <--------      [Application Data]
   (EndOfEarlyData)
   {Finished}                -------->

   [Application Data]        <------->      [Application Data]
~~~
{: #tls-full title="TLS Handshake with 0-RTT"}

This 0-RTT handshake is only possible if the client and server have previously
communicated.  In the 1-RTT handshake, the client is unable to send protected
application data until it has received all of the handshake messages sent by the
server.

Two additional variations on this basic handshake exchange are relevant to this
document:

 * The server can respond to a ClientHello with a HelloRetryRequest, which adds
   an additional round trip prior to the basic exchange.  This is needed if the
   server wishes to request a different key exchange key from the client.
   HelloRetryRequest is also used to verify that the client is correctly able to
   receive packets on the address it claims to have (see {{QUIC-TRANSPORT}}).

 * A pre-shared key mode can be used for subsequent handshakes to avoid public
   key operations.  This is the basis for 0-RTT data, even if the remainder of
   the connection is protected by a new Diffie-Hellman exchange.


# TLS Usage

QUIC reserves stream 1 for a TLS connection.  Stream 1 contains a complete TLS
connection, which includes the TLS record layer.  Other than the definition of a
QUIC-specific extension (see Section-TBD), TLS is unmodified for this use.  This
means that TLS will apply confidentiality and integrity protection to its
records.  In particular, TLS record protection is what provides confidentiality
protection for the TLS handshake messages sent by the server.

QUIC permits a client to send frames on streams starting from the first packet.
The initial packet from a client contains a stream frame for stream 1 that
contains the first TLS handshake messages from the client.  This allows the TLS
handshake to start with the first packet that a client sends.

QUIC packets are protected using a scheme that is specific to QUIC, see
{{packet-protection}}.  Keys are exported from the TLS connection when they
become available using a TLS exporter (see Section 7.3.3 of
{{!I-D.ietf-tls-tls13}} and {{key-expansion}}).  After keys are exported from
TLS, QUIC manages its own key schedule.


## Handshake and Setup Sequence

The integration of QUIC with a TLS handshake is shown in more detail in
{{quic-tls-handshake}}.  QUIC `STREAM` frames on stream 1 carry the TLS
handshake.  QUIC performs loss recovery {{QUIC-RECOVERY}} for this stream and
ensures that TLS handshake messages are delivered in the correct order.

~~~

~~~
{: #quic-tls-handshake title="QUIC over TLS Handshake"}

In {{quic-tls-handshake}}, symbols mean:

* "<" and ">" enclose stream numbers.
* "@" indicates the key phase that is currently used for protecting QUIC
  packets.
* "(" and ")" enclose messages that are protected with TLS 0-RTT handshake or
  application keys.
* "{" and "}" enclose messages that are protected by the TLS Handshake keys.

If 0-RTT is not attempted, then the client does not send packets protected by
the 0-RTT key (@0).  In that case, the only key transition on the client is from
unprotected packets (@C) to 1-RTT protection (@1), which happens before it sends
its final set of TLS handshake messages.

The server sends TLS handshake messages without protection (@C).  The server
transitions from no protection (@C) to full 1-RTT protection (@1) after it sends
the last of its handshake messages.

Some TLS handshake messages are protected by the TLS handshake record
protection.  These keys are not exported from the TLS connection for use in
QUIC.  QUIC packets from the server are sent in the clear until the final
transition to 1-RTT keys.

The client transitions from cleartext (@C) to 0-RTT keys (@0) when sending 0-RTT
data, and subsequently to to 1-RTT keys (@1) for its second flight of TLS
handshake messages.  This creates the potential for unprotected packets to be
received by a server in close proximity to packets that are protected with 1-RTT
keys.

More information on key transitions is included in {{cleartext-hs}}.


## Interface to TLS

As shown in {{schematic}}, the interface from QUIC to TLS consists of three
primary functions: Handshake, Key Ready Events, and Secret Export.

Additional functions might be needed to configure TLS.


### Handshake Interface

In order to drive the handshake, TLS depends on being able to send and receive
handshake messages on stream 1.  There are two basic functions on this
interface: one where QUIC requests handshake messages and one where QUIC
provides handshake packets.

Before starting the handshake QUIC provides TLS with the transport parameters
(see {{quic_parameters}}) that it wishes to carry.

A QUIC client starts TLS by requesting TLS handshake octets from
TLS.  The client acquires handshake octets before sending its first packet.

A QUIC server starts the process by providing TLS with stream 1 octets.

Each time that an endpoint receives data on stream 1, it delivers the octets to
TLS if it is able.  Each time that TLS is provided with new data, new handshake
octets are requested from TLS.  TLS might not provide any octets if the
handshake messages it has received are incomplete or it has no data to send.

Once the TLS handshake is complete, this is indicated to QUIC along with any
final handshake octets that TLS needs to send.  TLS also provides QUIC with the
transport parameters that the peer advertised during the handshake.

Once the handshake is complete, TLS becomes passive.  TLS can still receive data
from its peer and respond in kind, but it will not need to send more data unless
specifically requested - either by an application or QUIC.  One reason to send
data is that the server might wish to provide additional or updated session
tickets to a client.

When the handshake is complete, QUIC only needs to provide TLS with any data
that arrives on stream 1.  In the same way that is done during the handshake,
new data is requested from TLS after providing received data.

Important:

: Until the handshake is reported as complete, the connection and key exchange
  are not properly authenticated at the server.  Even though 1-RTT keys are
  available to a server after receiving the first handshake messages from a
  client, the server cannot consider the client to be authenticated until it
  receives and validates the client's Finished message.

: The requirement for the server to wait for the client Finished message creates
  a dependency on that message being delivered.  A client can avoid the
  potential for head-of-line blocking that this implies by sending a copy of the
  STREAM frame that carries the Finished message in multiple packets.  This
  enables immediate server processing for those packets.


### Key Ready Events

TLS provides QUIC with signals when 0-RTT and 1-RTT keys are ready for use.
These events are not asynchronous, they always occur immediately after TLS is
provided with new handshake octets, or after TLS produces handshake octets.

When TLS has enough information to generate 1-RTT keys, it indicates their
availability.  On the client, this occurs after receiving the entirety of the
first flight of TLS handshake messages from the server.  A server indicates that
1-RTT keys are available after it sends its handshake messages.

This ordering ensures that a client sends its second flight of handshake
messages protected with 1-RTT keys.  More importantly, it ensures that the
server sends its flight of handshake messages without protection.

If 0-RTT is possible, it is ready after the client sends a TLS ClientHello
message or the server receives that message.  After providing a QUIC client with
the first handshake octets, the TLS stack might signal that 0-RTT keys are
ready.  On the server, after receiving handshake octets that contain a
ClientHello message, a TLS server might signal that 0-RTT keys are available.

1-RTT keys are used for packets in both directions.  0-RTT keys are only
used to protect packets sent by the client.


### Secret Export

Details how secrets are exported from TLS are included in {{key-expansion}}.


### TLS Interface Summary

{{exchange-summary}} summarizes the exchange between QUIC and TLS for both
client and server.

{: #exchange-summary title="Interaction Summary between QUIC and TLS"}


## TLS Version

This document describes how TLS 1.3 {{!I-D.ietf-tls-tls13}} is used with QUIC.

In practice, the TLS handshake will negotiate a version of TLS to use.  This
could result in a newer version of TLS than 1.3 being negotiated if both
endpoints support that version.  This is acceptable provided that the features
of TLS 1.3 that are used by QUIC are supported by the newer version.

A badly configured TLS implementation could negotiate TLS 1.2 or another older
version of TLS.  An endpoint MUST terminate the connection if a version of TLS
older than 1.3 is negotiated.


## Peer Authentication

The requirements for authentication depend on the application protocol that is
in use.  TLS provides server authentication and permits the server to request
client authentication.

A client MUST authenticate the identity of the server.  This typically involves
verification that the identity of the server is included in a certificate and
that the certificate is issued by a trusted entity (see for example
{{?RFC2818}}).

A server MAY request that the client authenticate during the handshake. A server
MAY refuse a connection if the client is unable to authenticate when requested.
The requirements for client authentication vary based on application protocol
and deployment.

A server MUST NOT use post-handshake client authentication (see Section 4.6.2 of
{{!I-D.ietf-tls-tls13}}).


# QUIC Packet Protection {#packet-protection}

QUIC packet protection provides authenticated encryption of packets.  This
provides confidentiality and integrity protection for the content of packets
(see {{aead}}).  Packet protection uses keys that are exported from the TLS
connection (see {{key-expansion}}).

Different keys are used for QUIC packet protection and TLS record protection.
Having separate QUIC and TLS record protection means that TLS records can be
protected by two different keys.  This redundancy is limited to only a few TLS
records, and is maintained for the sake of simplicity.


## Installing New Keys {#new-key}

As TLS reports the availability of keying material, the packet protection keys
and initialization vectors (IVs) are updated (see {{key-expansion}}).  The
selection of AEAD function is also updated to match the AEAD negotiated by TLS.

For packets other than any unprotected handshake packets (see {{cleartext-hs}}),
once a change of keys has been made, packets with higher packet numbers MUST use
the new keying material.  The KEY_PHASE bit on these packets is inverted each
time new keys are installed to signal the use of the new keys to the recipient
(see {{key-phases}} for details).

An endpoint retransmits stream data in a new packet.  New packets have new
packet numbers and use the latest packet protection keys.  This simplifies key
management when there are key updates (see {{key-update}}).


## QUIC Key Expansion {#key-expansion}

QUIC uses a system of packet protection secrets, keys and IVs that are modelled
on the system used in TLS {{!I-D.ietf-tls-tls13}}.  The secrets that QUIC uses
as the basis of its key schedule are obtained using TLS exporters (see Section
7.3.3 of {{!I-D.ietf-tls-tls13}}).

QUIC uses HKDF with the same hash function negotiated by TLS for
key derivation.  For example, if TLS is using the TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256, the
SHA-256 hash function is used.


### 0-RTT Secret

0-RTT keys are those keys that are used in resumed connections prior to the
completion of the TLS handshake.  Data sent using 0-RTT keys might be replayed
and so has some restrictions on its use, see {{using-early-data}}.  0-RTT keys
are used after sending or receiving a ClientHello.

The secret is exported from TLS using the exporter label "EXPORTER-QUIC 0-RTT
Secret" and an empty context.  The size of the secret MUST be the size of the
hash output for the PRF hash function negotiated by TLS.  This uses the TLS
early_exporter_secret.  The QUIC 0-RTT secret is only used for protection of
packets sent by the client.

~~~
   client_0rtt_secret
       = TLS-Exporter("EXPORTER-QUIC 0-RTT Secret"
                      "", Hash.length)
~~~


### 1-RTT Secrets

1-RTT keys are used by both client and server after the TLS handshake completes.
There are two secrets used at any time: one is used to derive packet protection
keys for packets sent by the client, the other for protecting packets sent by
the server.

The initial client packet protection secret is exported from TLS using the
exporter label "EXPORTER-QUIC client 1-RTT Secret"; the initial server packet
protection secret uses the exporter label "EXPORTER-QUIC server 1-RTT Secret".
Both exporters use an empty context.  The size of the secret MUST be the size of
the hash output for the PRF hash function negotiated by TLS.

~~~
   client_pp_secret_0
       = TLS-Exporter("EXPORTER-QUIC client 1-RTT Secret"
                      "", Hash.length)
   server_pp_secret_0
       = TLS-Exporter("EXPORTER-QUIC server 1-RTT Secret"
                      "", Hash.length)
~~~

These secrets are used to derive the initial client and server packet protection
keys.

After a key update (see {{key-update}}), these secrets are updated using the
HKDF-Expand-Label function defined in Section 7.1 of {{!I-D.ietf-tls-tls13}}.
HKDF-Expand-Label uses the PRF hash function negotiated by TLS.  The
replacement secret is derived using the existing Secret, a Label of "QUIC client
1-RTT Secret" for the client and "QUIC server 1-RTT Secret" for the server, an
empty HashValue, and the same output Length as the hash function selected by TLS
for its PRF.

~~~
   client_pp_secret_<N+1>
       = HKDF-Expand-Label(client_pp_secret_<N>,
                           "QUIC client 1-RTT Secret",
                           "", Hash.length)
   server_pp_secret_<N+1>
       = HKDF-Expand-Label(server_pp_secret_<N>,
                           "QUIC server 1-RTT Secret",
                           "", Hash.length)
~~~

This allows for a succession of new secrets to be created as needed.

HKDF-Expand-Label uses HKDF-Expand {{!RFC5869}} with a specially formatted info
parameter.  The info parameter that includes the output length (in this case,
the size of the PRF hash output) encoded on two octets in network byte order,
the length of the prefixed Label as a single octet, the value of the Label
prefixed with "TLS 1.3, ", and a zero octet to indicate an empty HashValue.  For
example, the client packet protection secret uses an info parameter of:

~~~
   info = (HashLen / 256) || (HashLen % 256) || 0x21 ||
          "TLS 1.3, QUIC client 1-RTT secret" || 0x00
~~~


### Packet Protection Key and IV

The complete key expansion uses an identical process for key expansion as
defined in Section 7.3 of {{!I-D.ietf-tls-tls13}}, using different values for
the input secret.  QUIC uses the AEAD function negotiated by TLS.

The packet protection key and IV used to protect the 0-RTT packets sent by a
client use the QUIC 0-RTT secret.  This uses the HKDF-Expand-Label with the PRF
hash function negotiated by TLS.

The length of the output is determined by the requirements of the AEAD function
selected by TLS.  The key length is the AEAD key size.  As defined in Section
5.3 of {{!I-D.ietf-tls-tls13}}, the IV length is the larger of 8 or N_MIN (see
Section 4 of {{!RFC5116}}).

~~~
   client_0rtt_key = HKDF-Expand-Label(client_0rtt_secret,
                                       "key", "", key_length)
   client_0rtt_iv = HKDF-Expand-Label(client_0rtt_secret,
                                      "iv", "", iv_length)
~~~

Similarly, the packet protection key and IV used to protect 1-RTT packets sent
by both client and server use the current packet protection secret.

~~~
   client_pp_key_<N> = HKDF-Expand-Label(client_pp_secret_<N>,
                                         "key", "", key_length)
   client_pp_iv_<N> = HKDF-Expand-Label(client_pp_secret_<N>,
                                        "iv", "", iv_length)
   server_pp_key_<N> = HKDF-Expand-Label(server_pp_secret_<N>,
                                         "key", "", key_length)
   server_pp_iv_<N> = HKDF-Expand-Label(server_pp_secret_<N>,
                                        "iv", "", iv_length)
~~~

The client protects (or encrypts) packets with the client packet protection key
and IV; the server protects packets with the server packet protection key.

The QUIC record protection initially starts without keying material.  When the
TLS state machine reports that the ClientHello has been sent, the 0-RTT keys can
be generated and installed for writing.  When the TLS state machine reports
completion of the handshake, the 1-RTT keys can be generated and installed for
writing.


## QUIC AEAD Usage {#aead}

The Authentication Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) {{!RFC5116}} function
used for QUIC packet protection is AEAD that is negotiated for use with the TLS
connection.  For example, if TLS is using the TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256, the
AEAD_AES_128_GCM function is used.

Regular QUIC packets are protected by an AEAD {{!RFC5116}}.  Version negotiation
and public reset packets are not protected.

Once TLS has provided a key, the contents of regular QUIC packets immediately
after any TLS messages have been sent are protected by the AEAD selected by TLS.

The key, K, for the AEAD is either the client packet protection key
(client_pp_key_n) or the server packet protection key (server_pp_key_n), derived
as defined in {{key-expansion}}.

The nonce, N, for the AEAD is formed by combining either the packet protection
IV (either client_pp_iv_n or server_pp_iv_n) with packet numbers.  The 64 bits
of the reconstructed QUIC packet number in network byte order is left-padded
with zeros to the size of the IV.  The exclusive OR of the padded packet number
and the IV forms the AEAD nonce.

The associated data, A, for the AEAD is the contents of the QUIC header,
starting from the flags octet in the common header.

The input plaintext, P, for the AEAD is the contents of the QUIC frame following
the packet number, as described in {{QUIC-TRANSPORT}}.

The output ciphertext, C, of the AEAD is transmitted in place of P.

Prior to TLS providing keys, no record protection is performed and the
plaintext, P, is transmitted unmodified.


## Packet Numbers {#packet-number}

QUIC has a single, contiguous packet number space.  In comparison, TLS
restarts its sequence number each time that record protection keys are
changed.  The sequence number restart in TLS ensures that a compromise of the
current traffic keys does not allow an attacker to truncate the data that is
sent after a key update by sending additional packets under the old key
(causing new packets to be discarded).

QUIC does not assume a reliable transport and is required to handle attacks
where packets are dropped in other ways.  QUIC is therefore not affected by this
form of truncation.

The packet number is not reset and it is not permitted to go higher than its
maximum value of 2^64-1.  This establishes a hard limit on the number of packets
that can be sent.

Some AEAD functions have limits for how many packets can be encrypted under the
same key and IV (see for example {{AEBounds}}).  This might be lower than the
packet number limit.  An endpoint MUST initiate a key update ({{key-update}})
prior to exceeding any limit set for the AEAD that is in use.

TLS maintains a separate sequence number that is used for record protection on
the connection that is hosted on stream 1.  This sequence number is not visible
to QUIC.


# Key Phases

As TLS reports the availability of 0-RTT and 1-RTT keys, new keying material can
be exported from TLS and used for QUIC packet protection.  At each transition
during the handshake a new secret is exported from TLS and packet protection
keys are derived from that secret.

Every time that a new set of keys is used for protecting outbound packets, the
KEY_PHASE bit in the public flags is toggled.  The exception is the transition
from 0-RTT keys to 1-RTT keys, where the presence of the version field and its
associated bit is used (see {{first-keys}}).

Once the connection is fully enabled, the KEY_PHASE bit allows a recipient to
detect a change in keying material without necessarily needing to receive the
first packet that triggered the change.  An endpoint that notices a changed
KEY_PHASE bit can update keys and decrypt the packet that contains the changed
bit, see {{key-update}}.

The KEY_PHASE bit is the third bit of the public flags (0x04).

Transitions between keys during the handshake are complicated by the need to
ensure that TLS handshake messages are sent with the correct packet protection.


## Packet Protection for the TLS Handshake {#cleartext-hs}

The initial exchange of packets are sent without protection.  These packets are
marked with a KEY_PHASE of 0.

TLS handshake messages that are critical to the TLS key exchange cannot be
protected using QUIC packet protection.  A KEY_PHASE of 0 is used for all of
these packets, even during retransmission.  The messages critical to key
exchange are the TLS ClientHello and any TLS handshake message from the server,
except those that are sent after the handshake completes, such as
NewSessionTicket.

The second flight of TLS handshake messages from the client, and any TLS
handshake messages that are sent after completing the TLS handshake do not need
special packet protection rules.  This includes the EndOfEarlyData message that
is sent by a client to mark the end of its 0-RTT data.  Packets containing these
messages use the packet protection keys that are current at the time of sending
(or retransmission).

Like the client, a server MUST send retransmissions of its unprotected handshake
messages or acknowledgments for unprotected handshake messages sent by the
client in unprotected packets (KEY_PHASE=0).


### Initial Key Transitions {#first-keys}

Once the TLS key exchange is complete, keying material is exported from TLS and
QUIC packet protection commences.

Packets protected with 1-RTT keys have a KEY_PHASE bit set to 1.  These packets
also have a VERSION bit set to 0.

If the client is unable to send 0-RTT data - or it does not have 0-RTT data to
send - packet protection with 1-RTT keys starts with the packets that contain
its second flight of TLS handshake messages.  That is, the flight containing the
TLS Finished handshake message and optionally a Certificate and
CertificateVerify message.

If the client sends 0-RTT data, it marks packets protected with 0-RTT keys with
a KEY_PHASE of 1 and a VERSION bit of 1.  Setting the version bit means that all
packets also include the version field.  The client removes the VERSION bit when
it transitions to using 1-RTT keys, but it does not change the KEY_PHASE bit.

Marking 0-RTT data with the both KEY_PHASE and VERSION bits ensures that the
server is able to identify these packets as 0-RTT data in case the packet
containing the TLS ClientHello is lost or delayed.  Including the version also
ensures that the packet format is known to the server in this case.

Using both KEY_PHASE and VERSION also ensures that the server is able to
distinguish between cleartext handshake packets (KEY_PHASE=0, VERSION=1), 0-RTT
protected packets (KEY_PHASE=1, VERSION=1), and 1-RTT protected packets
(KEY_PHASE=1, VERSION=0).  Packets with all of these markings can arrive
concurrently, and being able to identify each cleanly ensures that the correct
packet protection keys can be selected and applied.

A server might choose to retain 0-RTT packets that arrive before a TLS
ClientHello.  The server can then use those packets once the ClientHello
arrives.  However, the potential for denial of service from buffering 0-RTT
packets is significant.  These packets cannot be authenticated and so might be
employed by an attacker to exhaust server resources.  Limiting the number of
packets that are saved might be necessary.

The server transitions to using 1-RTT keys after sending its first flight of TLS
handshake messages.  From this point, the server protects all packets with 1-RTT
keys.  Future packets are therefore protected with 1-RTT keys and marked with a
KEY_PHASE of 1.


### Retransmission and Acknowledgment of Unprotected Packets

The first flight of TLS handshake messages from both client and server
(ClientHello, or ServerHello through to the server's Finished) are critical to
the key exchange.  The contents of these messages determines the keys used to
protect later messages.  If these handshake messages are included in packets
that are protected with these keys, they will be indecipherable to the
recipient.

Even though newer keys could be available when retranmitting, retransmissions of
these handshake messages MUST be sent in unprotected packets (with a KEY_PHASE
of 0).  An endpoint MUST also generate ACK frames for these messages that are
sent in unprotected packets.

The TLS handshake messages that are affected by this rule are specifically:

* A client MUST NOT restransmit a TLS ClientHello with 0-RTT keys.  The server
  needs this message in order to determine the 0-RTT keys.

* A server MUST NOT retransmit any of its TLS handshake messages with 1-RTT
  keys.  The client needs these messages in order to determine the 1-RTT keys.

A HelloRetryRequest handshake message might be used to reject an initial
ClientHello.  A HelloRetryRequest handshake message and any second ClientHello
that is sent in response MUST also be sent without packet protection.  This is
natural, because no new keying material will be available when these messages
need to be sent.  Upon receipt of a HelloRetryRequest, a client SHOULD cease any
transmission of 0-RTT data; 0-RTT data will only be discarded by any server that
sends a HelloRetryRequest.

Note:

: TLS handshake data that needs to be sent without protection is all the
  handshake data acquired from TLS before the point that 1-RTT keys are provided
  by TLS (see {{key-ready-events}}).

The KEY_PHASE and VERSION bits ensure that protected packets are clearly
distinguished from unprotected packets.  Loss or reordering might cause
unprotected packets to arrive once 1-RTT keys are in use, unprotected packets
are easily distinguished from 1-RTT packets.

Once 1-RTT keys are available to an endpoint, it no longer needs the TLS
handshake messages that are carried in unprotected packets.  However, a server
might need to retransmit its TLS handshake messages in response to receiving an
unprotected packet that contains ACK frames.  A server MUST process ACK frames
in unprotected packets until the TLS handshake is reported as complete, or it
receives an ACK frame in a protected packet that acknowledges all of its
handshake messages.

To limit the number of key phases that could be active, an endpoint MUST NOT
initiate a key update while there are any unacknowledged handshake messages, see
{{key-update}}.


## Key Update {#key-update}

Once the TLS handshake is complete, the KEY_PHASE bit allows for refreshes of
keying material by either peer.  Endpoints start using updated keys immediately
without additional signaling; the change in the KEY_PHASE bit indicates that a
new key is in use.

An endpoint MUST NOT initiate more than one key update at a time.  A new key
cannot be used until the endpoint has received and successfully decrypted a
packet with a matching KEY_PHASE.  Note that when 0-RTT is attempted the value
of the KEY_PHASE bit will be different on packets sent by either peer.

A receiving endpoint detects an update when the KEY_PHASE bit doesn't match what
it is expecting.  It creates a new secret (see {{key-expansion}}) and the
corresponding read key and IV.  If the packet can be decrypted and authenticated
using these values, then the keys it uses for packet protection are also
updated.  The next packet sent by the endpoint will then use the new keys.

An endpoint doesn't need to send packets immediately when it detects that its
peer has updated keys.  The next packet that it sends will simply use the new
keys.  If an endpoint detects a second update before it has sent any packets
with updated keys it indicates that its peer has updated keys twice without
awaiting a reciprocal update.  An endpoint MUST treat consecutive key updates as
a fatal error and abort the connection.

An endpoint SHOULD retain old keys for a short period to allow it to decrypt
packets with smaller packet numbers than the packet that triggered the key
update.  This allows an endpoint to consume packets that are reordered around
the transition between keys.  Packets with higher packet numbers always use the
updated keys and MUST NOT be decrypted with old keys.

Keys and their corresponding secrets SHOULD be discarded when an endpoint has
received all packets with sequence numbers lower than the lowest sequence number
used for the new key.  An endpoint might discard keys if it determines that the
length of the delay to affected packets is excessive.

This ensures that once the handshake is complete, packets with the same
KEY_PHASE will have the same packet protection keys, unless there are multiple
key updates in a short time frame succession and significant packet reordering.

{: #ex-key-update title="Key Update"}

As shown in {{quic-tls-handshake}} and {{ex-key-update}}, there is never a
situation where there are more than two different sets of keying material that
might be received by a peer.  Once both sending and receiving keys have been
updated,

A server cannot initiate a key update until it has received the client's
Finished message.  Otherwise, packets protected by the updated keys could be
confused for retransmissions of handshake messages.  A client cannot initiate a
key update until all of its handshake messages have been acknowledged by the
server.


# Pre-handshake QUIC Messages {#pre-hs}

Implementations MUST NOT exchange data on any stream other than stream 1 without
packet protection.  QUIC requires the use of several types of frame for managing
loss detection and recovery during this phase.  In addition, it might be useful
to use the data acquired during the exchange of unauthenticated messages for
congestion control.

This section generally only applies to TLS handshake messages from both peers
and acknowledgments of the packets carrying those messages.  In many cases, the
need for servers to provide acknowledgments is minimal, since the messages that
clients send are small and implicitly acknowledged by the server's responses.

The actions that a peer takes as a result of receiving an unauthenticated packet
needs to be limited.  In particular, state established by these packets cannot
be retained once record protection commences.

There are several approaches possible for dealing with unauthenticated packets
prior to handshake completion:

* discard and ignore them
* use them, but reset any state that is established once the handshake completes
* use them and authenticate them afterwards; failing the handshake if they can't
  be authenticated
* save them and use them when they can be properly authenticated
* treat them as a fatal error

Different strategies are appropriate for different types of data.  This document
proposes that all strategies are possible depending on the type of message.

* Transport parameters are made usable and authenticated as part of the TLS
  handshake (see {{quic_parameters}}).

* Most unprotected messages are treated as fatal errors when received except for
  the small number necessary to permit the handshake to complete (see
  {{pre-hs-unprotected}}).

* Protected packets can either be discarded or saved and later used (see
  {{pre-hs-protected}}).


## Unprotected Packets Prior to Handshake Completion {#pre-hs-unprotected}

This section describes the handling of messages that are sent and received prior
to the completion of the TLS handshake.

Sending and receiving unprotected messages is hazardous.  Unless expressly
permitted, receipt of an unprotected message of any kind MUST be treated as a
fatal error.


### STREAM Frames

`STREAM` frames for stream 1 are permitted.  These carry the TLS handshake
messages.  Once 1-RTT keys are available, unprotected `STREAM` frames on stream
1 can be ignored.

Receiving unprotected `STREAM` frames for other streams MUST be treated as a
fatal error.


### ACK Frames

`ACK` frames are permitted prior to the handshake being complete.  Information
learned from `ACK` frames cannot be entirely relied upon, since an attacker is
able to inject these packets.  Timing and packet retransmission information from
`ACK` frames is critical to the functioning of the protocol, but these frames
might be spoofed or altered.

Endpoints MUST NOT use an unprotected `ACK` frame to acknowledge data that was
protected by 0-RTT or 1-RTT keys.  An endpoint MUST ignore an unprotected `ACK`
frame if it claims to acknowledge data that was sent in a protected packet.
Such an acknowledgement can only serve as a denial of service, since an endpoint
that can read protected data is always able to send protected data.

ISSUE:

: What about 0-RTT data?  Should we allow acknowledgment of 0-RTT with
  unprotected frames?  If we don't, then 0-RTT data will be unacknowledged until
  the handshake completes.  This isn't a problem if the handshake completes
  without loss, but it could mean that 0-RTT stalls when a handshake packet
  disappears for any reason.

An endpoint SHOULD use data from unprotected or 0-RTT-protected `ACK` frames
only during the initial handshake and while they have insufficient information
from 1-RTT-protected `ACK` frames.  Once sufficient information has been
obtained from protected messages, information obtained from less reliable
sources can be discarded.


### WINDOW_UPDATE Frames

`WINDOW_UPDATE` frames MUST NOT be sent unprotected.

Though data is exchanged on stream 1, the initial flow control window is
sufficiently large to allow the TLS handshake to complete.  This limits the
maximum size of the TLS handshake and would prevent a server or client from
using an abnormally large certificate chain.

Stream 1 is exempt from the connection-level flow control window.


### Denial of Service with Unprotected Packets

Accepting unprotected - specifically unauthenticated - packets presents a denial
of service risk to endpoints.  An attacker that is able to inject unprotected
packets can cause a recipient to drop even protected packets with a matching
sequence number.  The spurious packet shadows the genuine packet, causing the
genuine packet to be ignored as redundant.

Once the TLS handshake is complete, both peers MUST ignore unprotected packets.
From that point onward, unprotected messages can be safely dropped.

Since only TLS handshake packets and acknowledgments are sent in the clear, an
attacker is able to force implementations to rely on retransmission for packets
that are lost or shadowed.  Thus, an attacker that intends to deny service to an
endpoint has to drop or shadow protected packets in order to ensure that their
victim continues to accept unprotected packets.  The ability to shadow packets
means that an attacker does not need to be on path.

ISSUE:

: This would not be an issue if QUIC had a randomized starting sequence number.
  If we choose to randomize, we fix this problem and reduce the denial of
  service exposure to on-path attackers.  The only possible problem is in
  authenticating the initial value, so that peers can be sure that they haven't
  missed an initial message.

In addition to causing valid packets to be dropped, an attacker can generate
packets with an intent of causing the recipient to expend processing resources.
See {{useless}} for a discussion of these risks.

To avoid receiving TLS packets that contain no useful data, a TLS implementation
MUST reject empty TLS handshake records and any record that is not permitted by
the TLS state machine.  Any TLS application data or alerts that is received
prior to the end of the handshake MUST be treated as a fatal error.


## Use of 0-RTT Keys {#using-early-data}

If 0-RTT keys are available, the lack of replay protection means that
restrictions on their use are necessary to avoid replay attacks on the protocol.

A client MUST only use 0-RTT keys to protect data that is idempotent.  A client
MAY wish to apply additional restrictions on what data it sends prior to the
completion of the TLS handshake.  A client otherwise treats 0-RTT keys as
equivalent to 1-RTT keys.

A client that receives an indication that its 0-RTT data has been accepted by a
server can send 0-RTT data until it receives all of the server's handshake
messages.  A client SHOULD stop sending 0-RTT data if it receives an indication
that 0-RTT data has been rejected.

A server MUST NOT use 0-RTT keys to protect packets.


## Receiving Out-of-Order Protected Frames {#pre-hs-protected}

Due to reordering and loss, protected packets might be received by an endpoint
before the final TLS handshake messages are received.  A client will be unable
to decrypt 1-RTT packets from the server, whereas a server will be able to
decrypt 1-RTT packets from the client.

Packets protected with 1-RTT keys MAY be stored and later decrypted and used
once the handshake is complete.  A server MUST NOT use 1-RTT protected packets
before verifying either the client Finished message or - in the case that the
server has chosen to use a pre-shared key - the pre-shared key binder (see
Section 4.2.8 of {{!I-D.ietf-tls-tls13}}).  Verifying these values provides the
server with an assurance that the ClientHello has not been modified.

A server could receive packets protected with 0-RTT keys prior to receiving a
TLS ClientHello.  The server MAY retain these packets for later decryption in
anticipation of receiving a ClientHello.

Receiving and verifying the TLS Finished message is critical in ensuring the
integrity of the TLS handshake.  A server MUST NOT use protected packets from
the client prior to verifying the client Finished message if its response
depends on client authentication.


# QUIC-Specific Additions to the TLS Handshake

QUIC uses the TLS handshake for more than just negotiation of cryptographic
parameters.  The TLS handshake validates protocol version selection, provides
preliminary values for QUIC transport parameters, and allows a server to perform
return routeability checks on clients.


## Protocol and Version Negotiation {#version-negotiation}

The QUIC version negotiation mechanism is used to negotiate the version of QUIC
that is used prior to the completion of the handshake.  However, this packet is
not authenticated, enabling an active attacker to force a version downgrade.

To ensure that a QUIC version downgrade is not forced by an attacker, version
information is copied into the TLS handshake, which provides integrity
protection for the QUIC negotiation.  This does not prevent version downgrade
during the handshake, though it means that such a downgrade causes a handshake
failure.

TLS uses Application Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) {{!RFC7301}} to select an
application protocol.  The application-layer protocol MAY restrict the QUIC
versions that it can operate over.  Servers MUST select an application protocol
compatible with the QUIC version that the client has selected.

If the server cannot select a compatible combination of application protocol and
QUIC version, it MUST abort the connection. A client MUST abort a connection if
the server picks an incompatible combination of QUIC version and ALPN
identifier.


## QUIC Transport Parameters Extension {#quic_parameters}

QUIC transport parameters are carried in a TLS extension. Different versions of
QUIC might define a different format for this struct.

Including transport parameters in the TLS handshake provides integrity
protection for these values.

~~~
   enum {
      quic_transport_parameters(26), (65535)
   } ExtensionType;
~~~

The `extension_data` field of the quic_transport_parameters extension contains a
value that is defined by the version of QUIC that is in use.  The
quic_transport_parameters extension carries a TransportParameters when the
version of QUIC defined in {{QUIC-TRANSPORT}} is used.


## Priming 0-RTT

QUIC uses TLS without modification.  Therefore, it is possible to use a
pre-shared key that was obtained in a TLS connection over TCP to enable 0-RTT in
QUIC.  Similarly, QUIC can provide a pre-shared key that can be used to enable
0-RTT in TCP.

All the restrictions on the use of 0-RTT apply, with the exception of the ALPN
label, which MUST only change to a label that is explicitly designated as being
compatible.  The client indicates which ALPN label it has chosen by placing that
ALPN label first in the ALPN extension.

The certificate that the server uses MUST be considered valid for both
connections, which will use different protocol stacks and could use different
port numbers.  For instance, HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 operate over TLS and TCP,
whereas QUIC operates over UDP.

Source address validation is not completely portable between different protocol
stacks.  Even if the source IP address remains constant, the port number is
likely to be different.  Packet reflection attacks are still possible in this
situation, though the set of hosts that can initiate these attacks is greatly
reduced.  A server might choose to avoid source address validation for such a
connection, or allow an increase to the amount of data that it sends toward the
client without source validation.


# Security Considerations

There are likely to be some real clangers here eventually, but the current set
of issues is well captured in the relevant sections of the main text.

Never assume that because it isn't in the security considerations section it
doesn't affect security.  Most of this document does.


## Packet Reflection Attack Mitigation {#reflection}

A small ClientHello that results in a large block of handshake messages from a
server can be used in packet reflection attacks to amplify the traffic generated
by an attacker.

Certificate caching {{?RFC7924}} can reduce the size of the server's handshake
messages significantly.

A client SHOULD also pad {{!RFC7685}} its ClientHello to at least 1024 octets.
A server is less likely to generate a packet reflection attack if the data it
sends is a small multiple of the data it receives.  A server SHOULD use a
HelloRetryRequest if the size of the handshake messages it sends is likely to
exceed the size of the ClientHello.


## Peer Denial of Service {#useless}

QUIC, TLS and HTTP/2 all contain a messages that have legitimate uses in some
contexts, but that can be abused to cause a peer to expend processing resources
without having any observable impact on the state of the connection.  If
processing is disproportionately large in comparison to the observable effects
on bandwidth or state, then this could allow a malicious peer to exhaust
processing capacity without consequence.

QUIC prohibits the sending of empty `STREAM` frames unless they are marked with
the FIN bit.  This prevents `STREAM` frames from being sent that only waste
effort.

TLS records SHOULD always contain at least one octet of a handshake messages or
alert.  Records containing only padding are permitted during the handshake, but
an excessive number might be used to generate unnecessary work.  Once the TLS
handshake is complete, endpoints SHOULD NOT send TLS application data records
unless it is to hide the length of QUIC records.  QUIC packet protection does
not include any allowance for padding; padded TLS application data records can
be used to mask the length of QUIC frames.

While there are legitimate uses for some redundant packets, implementations
SHOULD track redundant packets and treat excessive volumes of any non-productive
packets as indicative of an attack.


# Error codes {#errors}

The portion of the QUIC error code space allocated for the crypto handshake is
0xC0000000-0xFFFFFFFF. The following error codes are defined when TLS is used
for the crypto handshake:

TLS_HANDSHAKE_FAILED (0xC000001C):
